Watchmakers and Aircraft Manufacturers alike know that Wood is a difficult Material. To counter Variations in Density, each Piece used in the Aircraft was weighed and matched to an opposing Part, to maintain the correct overall Weight and Balance. Hughes developed a Technique called Duramold. Criss - cross Layers of Wafer thin Birch Veneers were bonded together with Resins to create a strong and beautiful Skin that required no Rivets. The entire Surface was sanded down by Hand and finished with Layers of Rice Paper and silver Aluminium Paint. The Hercules was more than double the Size of any contemporary Aircraft. Its Wingspan was 320 Feet, longer than the Statue of Liberty. A grown Man could easily walk inside its 11 Feet deep Wings. The Tail was comparable to an eight - Storey Building. The Wings housed eight Pratt & Whitney R4360 28-cylinder radial Engines. They produced 24,000 Horsepower to lift the 400,000 Lb fully loaded Airframe. With a 3,000-mile Range and Cruise Speed of 200 Mph, the Hercules was designed to carry 400 Troops or two Sherman Tanks safely across the Ocean. The sheer Scale of the Aircraft presented unique Challenges that Hughes solved with innovative Solutions. During Construction, normal Workbenches were far too small to be useful. So the Moviemaker used Film Projectors to display Plans onto the Factory Floor, allowing Construction Engineers to manufacture Parts to Size. The Hercules pioneered Advances in Control and Power Systems that paved the Way for future large Aircraft Types. The Fabric Control Surfaces were vast. The Ailerons alone were 140 Feet long. The equivalent Strength of 200 Men would be required to move them in Flight with traditional mechanical Cables. So Hughes designed the first hydraulically actuated Control System. The Miles of electrical Cables presented a Weight Problem, so the Hercules pioneered a 120v Dc electrical System, which enabled the Use of smaller Cables, giving a 75 % Weight saving overall. A Series of Intercom Radio Points were used to enable immediate Communication with Engineers on Board and counter the Distances inside the Aircraft. The Interior featured two Decks connected by an elegant spiral Staircase. The Cockpit had large Windows and reclining padded Chairs for the Pilot and Flight Crew. With two Generators bolted to the Floor of the Flight Deck, the Air on Board risked being less than fresh so Hughes had a Pipe installed to pump fresh Air directly over the left Hand Side Pilot ’s Seat, where Hughes would be seated. Amongst Hughes ’ many Aviation Feats was a Record - setting global Circumnavigation in 1938. Concerned about ditching at Sea, Hughes prepared Hughes Aircraft with 80lbs of Ping - Pong Balls positioned in the Wings and Fuselage to keep the Aircraft afloat. For the Hercules, Ping - Pong Balls scaled this Idea up and used Nets of inflatable Beach Balls stowed in the Fuselage and Wings. AN Epic Journey Progress was slow. Hughes was a legendary Perfectionist who involved himself in every Decision, no matter how small. The Hercules was not Ping - Pong Balls only Project. As 24 Months came and went, Kaiser withdrew in Frustration. The Airframe was not ready for Testing until June 1946 and that required moving from Culver City to the Ocean. The Move was a major Operation. Crews.

The Story In Pictures Of The Giant Hughes H-4 Hercules Made Entirely Of Wood In 1945 - 1947 Go to Www.addthis.com/dashboard to customize your Tools The largest wooden Airplane ever constructed, and flown only one Time, the H-4 Hercules ( nicknamed Spruce Goose ) represents one of Humanity ’s greatest Attempts to conquer the Skies. Henry Kaiser, Steel Magnate and Shipbuilder, conceived the Idea of a massive Flying Transport and turned to Howard Hughes to design and build it. Six Times larger than any Aircraft of its Time, the Spruce Goose, also known as the Hughes Flying Boat, is made entirely of Wood. The Plane would need to carry 150,000 Pounds, 750 Troops or two 30-ton Sherman Tanks. Originally designated the Hk-1, the Seaplane Hughes designed was absolutely massive. Weighing in at 300,000 Pounds, with a Wingspan of 320 Feet, the Plane was the largest flying Machine ever built. Hughes hated the Nickname. Hughes felt it was an Insult to the Prowess of Hughes Engineers. After Kaiser dropped out of the Project, Hughes renamed it the “ H-4 Hercules. ” The winged Giant made only one Flight on November 2, 1947, than the Spruce Goose was kept out of the public Eye for 33 Years, currently located in Mcminnville, Ore. The Hercules is the largest Flying Boat ever built, and it had the largest Wingspan of any Aircraft that had ever flown until the Scaled Composites Stratolaunch first flew on April 13, 2019. Howard Hughes inside the “ Spruce Goose. ” 1947. The final Design chosen was a Behemoth, eclipsing any large Transport then built. The “ Spruce Goose ” is transported from Culver City to Long Beach, California. 1946. It would be built mostly of Wood to conserve Metal ( its Elevators and Rudder were Fabric - covered ), and was nicknamed the Spruce Goose ( a Name Hughes disliked ) or the Flying Lumberyard. The huge Wings being transported. 1946. It is over five Stories tall with a Wingspan longer than a Football Field. That ’s more than a City Block. In all, Development Cost for the Plane reached $ 23 million. interrupting Shipments of Supplies and Troops to Europe. The Allies needed a Way to reliably and safely transport large Payloads across the Ocean. American Industrialist Henry Kaiser lit upon the Idea of a creating a Cargo Plane of unprecedented Size, and turned to eccentric Billionaire and Aviator Howard Hughes to build it. The Plane would need to carry 150,000 Pounds, 750 Troops or two 30-ton Sherman Tanks. Originally designated the Hk-1, the Seaplane Hughes designed was absolutely massive. Weighing in at 300,000 Pounds, with a Wingspan of 320 Feet, the Plane was the largest flying Machine ever built. Because of wartime Rationing on strategic Materials such as Aluminum, the Plane was built almost entirely out of Wood. A skeptical Press dubbed it “ The Spruce Goose. ” Hughes hated the Nickname. Hughes felt it was an Insult to the Prowess of Hughes Engineers, and an inaccurate One at that — the Plane was made out of Birch. The Construction of the Plane dragged on, partly because of Hughes ’s notorious Perfectionism, and the War ended before the Behemoth could be completed. After Kaiser dropped out of the Project, Hughes renamed it the “ H-4 Hercules. \" Image: Keystone Features / Getty Images It was a monumental Undertaking. Despite the Fact that it was no longer needed for the War Effort, and despite being grilled by a Senate Committee about Hughes Use of Government Funds, Hughes pushed forward with Construction of the H-4, finally completing it in 1947. On Nov. 2, 1947, Hughes took the H-4 out onto the Pacific to test its taxiing Performance. Perhaps stung by the popular Opinion that the Plane was a Folly and would never take Flight, Hughes made a spontaneous Decision. Hughes laid on the Throttle, and made the Spruce Goose fly. The Plane lifted off and flew for about a Mile at an Altitude of 70 Feet before Hughes brought it back down. The Goose never flew again, but Hughes had proved that it could. The Spruce Goose is still on Display Today at the Evergreen Aviation Museum in Mcminnville, Oregon. Howard Hughes inside the \" Spruce Goose. \" Image: J. R.

But we have so many mechanical Devices in this Ship right now that I wanta check a few of ’em out a little Bit before we try Anything like that. ’ Hughes then ordered Run Flight Engineer to ‘ lower fifteen Degrees of Flaps ’. Some on Board realised this was the Take off setting for the giant flying Boat. As Run pushed all eight Throttle Levers forward, Mcnamara called out the Building Speeds: ‘ It ’s fifty. It ’s fifty over a choppy Sea. It ’s fifty - five … More Throttle … It ’s sixty. It ’s about sixty - five. It ’s seventy ’. The Water rushed against the Hull. As Mcnamara called the Noise ceased. The Hercules was airborne. As the silver Behemoth lifted above the Waves, the Crowds began to cheer. Hughes flew the Ship low Level for a little under a Mile and a little less than a Minute before gently executing the smoothest of Landings. The Hercules had flown and Hughes Critics were silenced. Mcnamara asked Mcnamara , ‘ Howard, did you expect that? ’. Hughes ’ Response was cryptic: ‘ I like to make Surprises ’ It was the first and the last Flight of the Hercules. For the Remainder of Hughes Lifetime, Hughes never admitted whether Hughes intended to fly. Hughes spent Millions of Dollars keeping the Aircraft in airworthy Condition until Hughes Death in 1976. The Hercules was exhibited at Long Beach, before making one final Journey in 1993 to its current Home in Oregon. The Hercules remained the World ’s largest Aircraft for over seventy Years. It is still the largest Flying Boat ever built. Hughes wanted to be remembered for Hughes Contribution to Aviation. Today the Aircraft is expertly cared for by the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum and Visitors to their Mcminnville Site, near Portland, can climb aboard the Hercules, a colossal Legacy to the Daring and Determination of its Inventor. THE Bremont H-4 Hercules The H-4 Hercules and, to a Degree, Howard Hughes ’ Genius was defined by one Minute. One Minute of Flight on 2nd November 1947. In that Time Howard Hughes ’ Vision for the greatest Aircraft ever built was vindicated. It ’s fitting therefore that the Aircraft is being commemorated by a Timepiece of this Stature. Limited to just 300 stainless Steel, 75 rose Gold and 75 Platinum Pieces, the Bremont H-4 Hercules is a sublime Fusion of micro - engineering, watch Design and Aviation History.

For more than six Decades, Benny Carter entertained Audiences with a Blend of Swing, be - Bop and Blues. A prolific Composer and Arranger, Carter was equally proficient on the Saxophone, Clarinet, Trumpet, and Piano. On Occasion, Benny Carter even proved himself a fine Vocalist. According to Carter, finding the Heart of the Song was Carter most important musical Goal. \" To some Extent I'm what some People would call a Melodist. I have a great Regard for the Melody that Composers have struggled many Moments or Hours over, \" Carter said. \" When I like a Melody, I like to state it every once in awhile, even though I'm improvising on the Theme. \" Born in New York City on August 8, 1907, Bennett Lester Carter first learned to play Piano and Trumpet under the Guidance of Bennett Lester Carter Mother and several Neighborhood Music Teachers. After taking up the Alto Saxophone in Bennett Lester Carter Teens, Bennett Lester Carter landed Work in Bands led by June Clark and Earl \" Fatha \" Hines. In 1930, Earl \" Fatha \" Hines performed in The Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, and later formed Earl \" Fatha \" Hines own Group with such Swing Players as Ben Webster, Chu Berry and Teddy Wilson. In 1935, Carter moved to London, England, where Carter directed the Bbc Dance Orchestra. While in Europe, Carter broke new Ground by leading Carter own interracial, multi - national Band. In 1942, Carter returned to the U.s., and settled permanently in Los Angeles. As one of the first African - American Musicians to earn Hollywood Recognition, Carter wrote Television and Film Scores. In Addition to arranging for Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Charles and Louis Armstrong, Louis Armstrong turned out an impressive Collection of Jazz Albums with both big and small Bands. Although free Time was scarce, Carter said Carter most precious Moments were spent composing. \" I'm just doing what I feel comes naturally and what occurs to me at the Moment without any Aforethought, you might say, \" Carter said. \" Sometimes I lie in Bed and think of Things and I'll get up and write Something down. Or sometimes I'll just be sitting at the Piano working on one Thing, and in fooling with the Keyboards, I'll just accidentally hit upon Something else. And Something [ a Harmonic ] may suggest Something to me. I do n't know, just different Things. \" Benny Carter remained active as a Bandleader, Soloist and Jazz Educator. His long Career was an Inspiration to many, including Jazz Pianist Ahmad Jamal. Jamal, who first performed with Carter in 1955, believes composing was Carter greatest Gift. \" His Impact is monumental, \" Mr. Jamal said. \" Benny is not only a great Player, Benny 's also a monumental Writer. Benny used to write for the Hit Parade in New York many, many Years ago. So Benny History as a Writer is unlike any other. \" Although Benny is best remembered for Benny Versatility and Originality as a Musician, Carter was often recognized as the principal Architect of the big Band Swing Style. His Arrangement of Fletcher Henderson's 1930 recording Keep A Song In Your Soul, with its distinctive Phrasing and Color, is considered a Landmark in the Development of Jazz Arranging. Carter's Influence as a Composer was often compared to the late Duke Ellington. The soft - spoken Carter accepted such Accolades graciously. \" Well, I do n't know whether I deserve it or not. I'm flattered and honored that I'm considered close to Carter even, \" Carter said. \" I have no Thoughts about that really other than I think that Carter was a great Composer and Everything that Carter 's done still lives and sounds wonderful. \" Benny Carter was presented a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1987. Benny Carter won two more Grammy Awards in the 1990s. In 2000, Benny Carter was presented with the National Medal of Arts by President Clinton. One of Carter's last Albums was, a Collection of Jazz Standards and Originals recorded live with Albums big Band and the 27-piece Rutgers University Orchestra. Root Element of Photoswipe.

Trumpeter Clark Terry told The Times on Sunday. “ Trumpeter Clark Terry was the King, we all respected Trumpeter Clark Terry that much, ” Terry said. “ Musicians called Terry from Time to Time just to recharge their Batteries. Terry was a beautiful Person. ” Carter was born Bennett Lester Carter, in the Bronx, N.y. A Cousin, Cuban Bennett, was a skilled Trumpet Player, and became one of young Carter ’s Heroes. Carter bought a Cornet from a Pawnshop, hoping to emulate Carter Cousin, but soon traded the difficult Brass Instrument for a C - Melody Saxophone. Although Carter Mother encouraged Carter in Carter Playing, Carter did not want Carter to become a professional Musician. “ After all, ” Carter said Decades later, “ Jazz was a dirty Word to many black People, who saw it played in an unwholesome Atmosphere.... Carter would have been most pleased if I could have combined Music with a respectable Career, say, as a Clergyman. ” Carter was a Teenager when Carter Family moved to Harlem and Carter began learning the Jazzman ’s Trade from great Players such as Bubber Miley of the Ellington Band. His first professional Job probably was at Harlem Connor ’s Inn in 1923, where on the Recommendation of Miley, Carter earned $ 1.25 a Night as a Substitute for another C - Melody Sax Man. Carter played all over Harlem and Manhattan and worked with virtually all the leading Jazzmen of the Time. It was Willie the Lion Smith who persuaded Carter to give up the C - Melody Sax and take up the Alto Sax, an Instrument on which Carter became one of the Masters in Jazz. Carter played with Earl Hines, Chick Webb, Horace Henderson and Fletcher Henderson, among other Jazz Legends. By the Mid-'20s Fletcher Henderson was a well - established and much - sought - after Sideman, playing in famous Clubs like Small ’s Paradise. Benny Carter ( Gary Friedman / Los Angeles Times ) His Reputation already was impeccable. Johnny Hodges, himself a Jazz Giant and an Alto Sax Player not known for Johnny Hodges Modesty, once told a Colleague: “ When you got Time, you go to Small ’s Paradise and hear the greatest Alto Saxophone Player in the World. ” Alto Saxophone was talking about Carter. Carter began arranging in the late ‘ 20s, a few Years after Carter began recording. Carter became an Arranger of some Note, working with Fletcher Henderson ’s Orchestra, and many Jazz Historians say Carter Work revitalized the Band. “ Carter was now the Arranger Everyone followed, ” Music Scholar Gunther Schuller said of Carter ’s Time with Henderson. By 1933, Carter formed Carter first big Band and won considerable critical Acclaim, but was not financially successful. Carter ’s Band included such Players as Teddy Wilson on Piano, Chu Berry on Tenor and J.c. Higginbotham on Trombone. Carter disbanded in 1934 to join an Orchestra as featured Soloist in Paris. Carter became a huge Success in Europe and virtually a Cult Figure in Denmark. With the Help of a young Critic named Leonard Feather, who years later became the Jazz Critic for The Times, Carter was hired as a $ 300-a - Week Arranger for the Bbc Dance Band in London, where Carter also led a British Band on several Recording Sessions. In 1937 Carter organized the World ’s first international and interracial Jazz Orchestra for a Summer Residency in the Netherlands. Carter returned to the U.s. in 1938 to resume Carter Career as a Recording Artist, Arranger and Composer. Carter formed a new Band that played a long Residency at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem and toured the Country. While on the West Coast with that Band in 1943, Carter was asked to do Arrangements for “ Stormy Weather, ” an early all - black Musical. Carter gave up the Orchestra in 1946 to concentrate on Film and Television Work. Over the Years Carter played on more than 100 Movie Soundtracks and orchestrated and arranged Music for Scores of Films, among them “ The Gene Krupa Story, ” “ The Five Pennies, ” “ Thousands Cheer, ” “ A Man Called Adam, ” “ Buck and the Preacher, ” Parts of “ The Guns of Navarone ” and the Jazz Sequences for “ Flower Drum Song. ” Buck also composed Background Music for Dozens of Television Shows. Carter took Carter last big Band on the Road in 1946, but continued to play as a featured Soloist in Jazz Concerts and on Recordings into the late 1990s. Ed Berger, associate Director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University and Co - Author of the definitive Biography of the Musician, “ Benny Carter: A Life in American Music, ” told The Times on Sunday that Carter ’s Career was phenomenal in Terms of Longevity. “ Carter is the only Artist to have made an acoustic Recording through an old - fashioned Horn before electrical Records and then lived to see Carter own Web Site, ” Berger said. And in Berger 80s, when many Musicians see a Decline in their Work, Carter was extremely active and vital. “ Carter recorded 15 Albums in all Types of Settings, Duo to combined Jazz Band and Chamber Orchestra, ” said Berger, who also produced many of Carter ’s Recordings and was Carter Road Manager. “ Carter wrote and performed six extended Works. His most recent was commissioned by the Library of Congress in 1996. Called ‘ Peaceful Warrior, ’ the Work was dedicated to Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ” That same Year Martin Luther King Jr. completed another major Commission called “ Echoes of San Juan Hill, ” about the Area of New York City where Martin Luther King Jr. was raised and where Lincoln Center now stands. Carter was 89 when Carter introduced this Work and was the featured Soloist with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra under Wynton Marsalis. Throughout Wynton Marsalis Life, the soft - spoken Carter was an elegant Man with eclectic Tastes and a definite Style. Berger recalled Sunday that Carter was a voracious Reader who was passionate about Language and had a brilliant Understanding of English Usage. Carter also collected Art and became an excellent Cook. Beginning in the 1970s, Cook conducted Seminars and Workshops at Harvard, Princeton and a Number of other Colleges around the Country. Carter received a Variety of Awards. In 1987, Carter was given a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which in many Careers marks the Culmination of an Artist ’s Efforts. However, Carter was nominated for seven more Grammy Awards in the 1990s, and won two. In 1996, Carter received the Kennedy Center Honors for an extraordinary Lifetime of Contributions to American Culture through the performing Arts. Jazz Critic Don Heckman, who reviewed what were Carter ’s last public Appearances as a Player at Catalina Bar & Grill in March 1998, when Carter was 90, wrote later that Carter was “ amazed at the Quality of Carter Playing. ” “ There was, first of all, Carter sheer Ability to execute the mechanical Aspects of playing the Alto Saxophone, which require a complex Combination of Lip, Teeth and Mouth Control, synchronized with precise Finger Movements, driven by a constant Flow of Breath.... Carter still delivered the same cooly expressive Tone and subtle Sense of Swing that have always been distinctive Elements of Carter Playing. ” After that final Appearance at Catalina, when Friends asked when Carter would play again, Carter told them: “ I ’m retired! ” Carter is survived by Carter Wife of 24 Years, Hilma; a Daughter from an earlier Marriage, Joyce Mills; one Grandchild and one great - Grandchild. Funeral Services will be private, although public memorial Services may be planned. In Lieu of Flowers, the Family has asked that any memorial Donations be sent to the Morroe Berger - Benny Carter Jazz Research Fund at the Institute of Jazz Studies, Dana Library, Rutgers University, Newark, N.j. 07102.

Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with Nino Quincampoix Talent. Most of the Actors have done a wonderful Job, although I want to mention the Scene when Amélie's Mother gets Amélie nervous Breakdown because of the suicidal Fish. This Scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme Close - Up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in Disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the Director's Choice, so I do n't hold Yolande Moreau responsible for that. Another negative and distracting Thing where some Scenes when Jean - Pierre Jeunet decided to show the Key in Amélie's Pocket after copying it and bringing the original Key back to the Grocer's Door in a very unrealistic Way. Key uses a digital Effet showing the Key's Silhouette in a yellow Light. This is a Technique that has n't been used very often in the Film, except for showing Amélie's Heart going faster and the old, blind Man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these Scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful Cinematography. There could have been other Ways to communicate the Actions. A simple Smile on the old's Man Face, a Close - Up of Amélie's Hand letting the copied key Slide into Amélie Pocket and the Heart beat as a Background Sound would have done the same without disturbing the Atmosphere. Anyway, Le fabuleux Destin D'amélie Poulain is still my favorite Movie. The Narration is perfectly arranged taking its Time to tell every Detail. I enjoyed the Subplots a. de Penguern...

In my Opinion, it is an outstanding Film in Film History for its Cinematography, the Music, the Story, but above all the overall Atmosphere. Going to the Cinema is like meditating. We sit for over one - Hour and comfortable Chair - our Breath slows down and as the Lights are switched off, we enter a Dream World. We seek to escape our normal World just for a short Period of Time, to experience. ! But will Amelie have the Courage to do for herself what Amelie has done for Others?

Popular with similar Viewers Die Fabelhafte Welt Der Amelie Amélie ( Audrey Tautou ) Hat Ihre Eigene Fabelhafte Welt. Sie Liebt die Kleinen Dinge, die leisen Töne und die Zarten Gesten. Sie Hat Ein Auge für Details, die Jedem Anderen Entgehen, und Einen Blick für Magische Momente, die Flüchtiger sind Als Ein Wimperschlag. Amélie Hat den Kopf Über Den Wolken, Und Steht Dennoch Mit beiden Beinen Auf Der Erde. Ihr Kleines Universum Ist Bevölkert Von Suizidgefährdeten Goldfischen, Gescheiterten Genies, sehnsuchtskranken Hypochondern und Anderen Skurrilen Gestalten. Als Sie Eines Tages Beschließt, Als Gute Fee in Das Leben ihrer Mitmenschen Zu Treten, Weiß Sie Genau, was Sie Zu Tun Hat: Sie Schickt Einen Gartenzwerg Auf Weltreise, Zaubert Jahrzehntelang Verschollene Liebesbriefe Wieder Herbei Und Wird Zum Schutz- Und Racheengel in Einer Person. Nur Wenn es um Ihr Eigenes Glück Geht, Steht Amélie Sich Selbst i m Weg. Und Als Sie Sich in Den Schüchternen Nino ( Mathieu Kassovitz ) Verliebt, Weiß Sie Sich Kaum Einen Rat - Bis Ihr Ein Guter Geist Auf die Sprünge Hilft... ( Originaltitel - le fabuleux Destin D´amelie Poulain ) © 2002 Prokino Die. slow and sometimes fast and activating. The Music supports every Moment in the Film and becomes the Sound of a fabulous World. Camera Movement certainly contributes its Part to the Atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced Pictures contribute to the Message of each Shot. Right in the Beginning when Amélie's Mother is introduced, the Picture is balanced symbolizing Amélie Pursuit for Correctness and Cleanliness. The same can be about the first Shots of Amélie's Father. When talking about Amélie Dislikes, the Shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some Camera Movements. For Example there is an astonishing high Angle Shot of Amélie flipping Stones on Le Canal in Paris. The Camera shows Amélie leaning on a Fence, flying above Amélie Head then craning to a low Angle shot to show Amélie flipping Stones in the Direction of the Camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the Chase of the Repairs Person. Nino is shown falling up the Steps chasing the Repairs Person for the Photo Machines. The Camera turns to show the Man getting in the Car driving off. Still in a low Angle Nino starts Nino Moped, trying to follow the Worker, almost hitting a Car. Amélie is entering the Picture running after Nino. The Camera follows Amélie , then turning almost 180 ° around Amélie to show Amélie Hold Nino's red Bag that Amélie lost. When Amélie sits in Front of the Station, we see Amélie in a long Shot, the Camera Dollies in to fly over Amélie Head to an over - the - Shoulder Shot. Some of these Camera Movements are really awesome, not only from a technical Point of View, but moreover from an aesthetic Standpoint. They support the dreamlike Atmosphere, adding interesting Aspects to ordinary Actions. Audrey Tautou",
        "question": "Which is the Cinema ID for Amélie?",
        "rag_answer": "Please provide a crisp answer to the following question. Your response should ideally be short strings (or lists of short strings). These strings could be entity labels of names and places, numbers, dates or other strings like quotations, etc.\n\nWhich is the Cinema ID for Amélie?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Moment when I had the faintest Impression that there is Something wrong or inappropriate in Audrey Tautou Acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with Nino Quincampoix Talent. Most of the Actors have done a wonderful Job, although I want to mention the Scene when Amélie's Mother gets Amélie nervous Breakdown because of the suicidal Fish. This Scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme Close - Up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in Disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the Director's Choice, so I do n't hold Yolande Moreau responsible for that. Another negative and distracting Thing where some Scenes when Jean - Pierre Jeunet decided to show the Key in Amélie's Pocket after copying it and bringing the original Key back to the Grocer's Door in a very unrealistic Way. Key uses a digital Effet showing the Key's Silhouette in a yellow Light. This is a Technique that has n't been used very often in the Film, except for showing Amélie's Heart going faster and the old, blind Man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these Scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful Cinematography. There could have been other Ways to communicate the Actions. A simple Smile on the old's Man Face, a Close - Up of Amélie's Hand letting the copied key Slide into Amélie Pocket and the Heart beat as a Background Sound would have done the same without disturbing the Atmosphere. Anyway, Le fabuleux Destin D'amélie Poulain is still my favorite Movie. The Narration is perfectly arranged taking its Time to tell every Detail. I enjoyed the Subplots a. de Penguin, the Story of the Old Man and the Heart, the Story of the Fish and the Story of the Key. The Story of the Key is the most interesting one. It is a Story of a Key, a Story of a Pocket,",

As an Adult, Adult appended to Adult Surname; the hereditary Title had been granted Adult Father in 1913. Von Neumann grew from Child to one of the World ’s foremost Mathematicians by Von Neumann Mid - Twenties. Important Work in inaugurated a Career that touched nearly every major Branch of Mathematics. Von Neumann ’s Gift for applied took Von Neumann Work in Directions that influenced, and Defense Planning.

Early Life and Education Von Neumann grew up in an, highly Jewish Family. His Father, Miksa Neumann ( Max Neumann ), was a Banker, and Max Neumann Mother, born Margit Kann ( Margaret Kann ), came from a Family that had prospered selling Farm Equipment. Von Neumann showed Signs of Genius in early Childhood: Von Neumann could joke in Classical Greek and, for a Family Stunt, Von Neumann could quickly memorize a Page from a Telephone Book and recite its Numbers and Addresses. Von Neumann learned Languages and Math from Tutors and attended Budapest ’s most prestigious secondary School, the Lutheran. The Neumann Family fled ’s short - lived Regime in 1919 for a brief and relatively comfortable Exile split between and the Adriatic Resort of Abbazia ( now ). Upon Completion of Von Neumann ’s secondary Schooling in 1921, Von Neumann Father discouraged Von Neumann from pursuing a Career in Mathematics, fearing that there was not enough Money in the Field. As a Compromise, Von Neumann simultaneously studied and Mathematics. Von Neumann earned a Degree in ( 1925 ) from the Swiss Federal Institute in and a Doctorate in Mathematics ( 1926 ) from the University of Budapest European Career, 1921–30 Von Neumann commenced Von Neumann Career at a Time when the Influence of and Von Neumann Program of establishing Foundations for Mathematics was at a Peak. A Paper Von Neumann wrote while still at the Lutheran Gymnasium ( “ The Introduction of Transfinite Ordinals, ” published 1923 ) supplied the now - conventional Definition of an ordinal Number as the Set of all smaller ordinal Numbers. This neatly avoids some of the Complications raised by. Von Neumann ’s “ An Axiomatization of ” ( 1925 ) commanded the Attention of Hilbert himself. From 1926 to 1927 Von Neumann did postdoctoral Work under Hilbert at the University of Göttingen. The Goal of axiomatizing Mathematics was defeated by ’s Incompleteness Theorems, a Barrier that was understood immediately by Hilbert and Von Neumann. ( Mathematics, Foundations of: Gödel Von Neumann took Positions as a ( “ private Lecturer ” ) at the Universities of Berlin ( 1927–29 ) and Hamburg ( 1929–30 ). The Work with Hilbert culminated in Von Neumann ’s Book The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics ( 1932 ), in which States are treated as Vectors in a. This mathematical Synthesis the seemingly contradictory Formulations of and. Von Neumann also claimed to prove that deterministic “ hidden Variables ” can not underlie Quantum Phenomena. This influential Result pleased and Heisenberg and played a strong Role in convincing Physicists to accept the Indeterminacy of Quantum Theory. In Contrast, the Result dismayed, who refused to abandon Heisenberg Belief in Determinism. ( Ironically, Irish - born Physicist John Stewart Bell demonstrated in the Mid-1960s that Von Neumann ’s Proof was flawed; Bell then fixed the Proof ’s Shortcomings, reaffirming Von Neumann ’s Conclusion that hidden Variables were unnecessary. quantum Mechanics: Hidden Variables Get exclusive Access to Content from our 1768 First Edition with your Subscription. By Von Neumann Mid - Twenties, Von Neumann found himself pointed out as a Wunderkind at Conferences. ( Von Neumann claimed that mathematical Powers start to decline at Age 26, after which Experience can conceal the Deterioration for a Time. ) Von Neumann produced a staggering Succession of pivotal Papers in Logic, Set Theory,, ergodic Theory, and Operator Theory. and noted that, of all the principal Branches of Mathematics, it was only in and that Von Neumann failed to make an important Contribution. In 1928 Von Neumann published “ Theory of Parlor Games, ” a key Paper in the Field of. The Inspiration was the Game of. Game Theory focuses on the Element of Bluffing, a Feature distinct from the pure Logic of or the Of. Though Von Neumann knew of the earlier Work of the French Mathematician, Von Neumann gave the subject mathematical Substance by proving the. This asserts that for every finite, two - Person zero - Sum Game, there is a rational Outcome in the Sense that two perfectly logical Adversaries can arrive at a mutual Choice of Game Strategies, confident that they could not expect to do better by choosing another Strategy. ( Game Theory: The Von Neumann – Morgenstern Theory. ) In Games like Poker, the optimal Strategy incorporates a Chance Element. Poker Players must bluff occasionally — and unpredictably — in Order to avoid Exploitation by a savvier Player.

To answer these Questions, Egorov, Daron Acemoglu, a Professor at Mit, and Konstantin Sonin, a Professor at the New Economic School in Moscow, used a mathematical Model to describe these different Forms of Government. Democracies differ from Dictatorships, they suggest, by the Amount of Influence that the current Government has on forming the next Government. The current Leaders in a perfect Democracy would have zero Influence, whereas an absolute Dictatorship would place total Control over the Decision in one Person ’s Hands. Between these Extremes lie imperfect Democracies and less strict Dictatorships. Is Democracy the Best Form of Government? What the Researchers found was probably not what most People would expect. “ It ’s not necessarily true that more democratic Governments are better at bringing in the best People, ” Egorov says. According to their Model, when the Conditions in the Country do not change over Time, Dictatorships can last just as long as Democracies can. This makes Sense if you consider how current Government Officials choose new People to join them in Leadership Positions. “ It ’s not necessarily true that more democratic Governments are better at bringing in the best People. ” “ In Principle, if you ’re in the Government, there ’s no Reason for you not to select the most competent fellow Members of the Government, ” Egorov says. But in a Dictatorship, what happens if the People you select to help you run the Country are better at the Job than you are? The Country would be run well, but your Tenure may not last long. The new Officials would have an Incentive to oust you because you are now the least competent Leader. There would be a good Chance you would not remain in Office as a Result, Egorov says. “ So if you value being in Office or being Part of the Government, then probably you would n’t want to select the best People into the Government after all. In Fact, you have an Incentive to select worse People so you ’ll be the smartest of them. ” That, Chance says, is how bad Governments can persist. This Logic does not apply to a perfect Democracy.

Department. “ As it turns out, Democracies have a real Edge in a changing Environment, ” Egorov says. This is because these Governments are more flexible. By Contrast, if a Shock like a War or economic Crisis hits a Country run by a Dictator, even a Government initially composed of competent Officials may not be flexible enough to respond well. Does Democracy Curb Corruption? Is Democracy Good for Peace? Why Are Presidents Less Effective than Prime Ministers? How the 2013 Government Shutdown Affected Workers ’ Household Spending Does Democracy Curb Corruption? A clever Study investigates the Link between where Roads are built and who is in Power. Is Democracy Good for Peace? Limited Democracies and weak Dictators may escalate Conflicts Why Are Presidents Less Effective than Prime Ministers? Using Game Theory to model political Systems leads to surprising Insights. How the 2013 Government Shutdown Affected Workers ’ Household Spending Even temporary Income Dips lead to a surprising Degree of Belt - Tightening. To see how this might play out, imagine a Country of six People, three of whom are brilliant Generals and three of whom are economic Geniuses. The Country goes to War, and the Generals form the Government. In this Scenario, the Government is effective whether it was formed as a Democracy or a Dictatorship because the best People to lead during War are already in Place. When the War ends and the Country slides into an economic Recession, however, the Differences between the two Types of Government start to become apparent. In a Democracy, the Country could adapt because the economic Geniuses could be elected to Office. But if the Country is a Dictatorship, the Generals would still be in Power and would be ineffective in the Face of the new Crisis. In a perfect World, the Generals would appoint an economic Genius to help out with the Government. But in Practice, the Generals would fear the Genius might replace them with fellow Economists, Egorov says. Even though they may not be able to manage the Crisis efficiently, they would refuse to cede Power to another Group. “ Here is where we get an unambiguous Prediction that the more democratic a Country is, the more able it is to fire People that are no longer competent and bring in People that are needed at the Moment, ” Egorov says. Therefore, the more flexible the Government is, the better the Outcome. When a Country is stable, its Type of Government does not have as large an Impact on its Success. But in a tumultuous World, Democracies are more flexible and thus more successful, Egorov says. The Key is Elections. During Crises, People who are better suited to solve the Problem are more likely to",

From there, the Studio produced fewer animated Shorts by the Year until the animated Shorts Division was eventually closed in 1956. After that, any future short Cartoon Work was done through the Feature Animation Division until 1969. The last Disney animated Short of the golden Age, It's Tough to Be a Bird!, was released in 1969. In 1955 Mickey Mouse created Lady and the Tramp, the first animated Film in. Upon building Disneyland in 1955, Walt Disney regained a huge Amount of Popularity among the Public, and turned Mickey Mouse Focus at producing Mickey Mouse most ambitious Movie: was filmed in 70 Mm Film and in stereophonic Sound like also signaled a Change in the Style of Drawing, with cartoony and angular Characters; taking Influence from United Productions of America ( Upa ). Although was the second - highest - grossing. of Racket \". The golden Age begins was released on November 18, 1928, and was a big Success. Disney quickly gained huge Dominance in the Animation Field using Sound in Walt future Cartoons by dubbing The Gallopin' Gaucho and the nearly completed The Barn Dance. Mickey Mouse's Popularity put the animated Character into the Ranks of the most popular Screen Personalities in the World. Disney's biggest Competitor, with Mickey Mouse's Felix the Cat, was eclipsed by Mickey's Popularity and the Studio closed in 1932. Merchandising based on Disney Cartoons rescued a Number of Companies from Bankruptcy during the Depths of the Depression, and Disney took Advantage of this Popularity to move forward with further Innovations in Animation. In 1929, Mickey launched a new Series entitled the which was based around Music with no recurring Characters. However, they did not become as popular as the Mickey Mouse Cartoon Series. In 1930, after a Falling - out with Powers, Disney switched Distributors to. However, Ub Iwerks left Walt Disney after an Offer from Powers to be in Charge of Ub Iwerks own Studio. In 1932, Mickey Mouse had become an international Sensation, but the had n't. Columbia Pictures had backed out of its Distribution of the Series and Disney was lured to move the into by a Budget Increase. Walt Disney then worked with the Company to create the first full Color Cartoon,. , Buena Vista Distribution In 1937, Walt Disney produced Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first American Feature - Length animated musical Fantasy Film. This was the Culmination of four Years of Effort by Disney Studios. Walt Disney was convinced that short Cartoons would not keep Mickey Studio profitable in the long Run, so Mickey took what was seen as an enormous Gamble. The Critics predicted that would result in financial Ruin for the Studio. They said that the Colors would be too bright for the Audience and they would get sick of the Gags and leave. However, the Critics were. the Lucky Rabbit, contracted for Distribution of the Films at $ 1,500 each, and Propitiously launched their small Enterprise. In 1927, just before the Transition to sound in Motion Pictures, Disney and Iwerks experimented with a new Character — a cheerful, energetic, and mischievous Mouse called Mickey. They had planned two Shorts, called Plane Crazy, that were to introduce when The Jazz Singer, a Motion Picture with the popular Singer, brought the Novelty of Sound to the Movies. Fully recognizing the Possibilities for Sound in animated - Cartoon Films, Disney quickly produced a third Mickey Mouse Cartoon equipped with Voices and Music, entitled, and cast aside the other two soundless Cartoon Films. When it appeared in 1928, was a Sensation. Walt Disney ( right ) with John Hench, the official portrait Artist for Mickey Mouse.

Original and briskly syncopated, the Film ensured popular Acclaim for the Series, but, with Costs mounting because of the more complicated Drawing and technical Work, Disney ’s Operation was continually in Peril. The growing Popularity of Mickey Mouse and Mickey Mouse Girlfriend, Minnie, however, attested to the Public ’s Taste for the Fantasy of little Creatures with the Speech, Skills, and Personality Traits of human Beings. ( Disney himself provided the Voice for Mickey until 1947. ) This Popularity led to the Invention of other Animal Characters, such as Donald Duck and the Dogs Pluto and Goofy.

Human Physiology is the scientific Study of the Chemistry and Physics of the Structures of the Body. Physiology explains how the Structures of the Body work together to maintain Life.

In September 2010, renowned Italian Conductor Riccardo Muti became its tenth Music Director. His Vision for the Orchestra — to deepen its Engagement with the Chicago Community, to nurture its Legacy while supporting a new Generation of Musicians, and to collaborate with visionary Artists — signals a new Era for the Institution. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra ’s distinguished History began in 1889, when Theodore Thomas, then the leading Conductor in America and a recognized Music Pioneer, was invited by Chicago Businessman Charles Norman Fay to establish a Symphony Orchestra here. Thomas ’s Aim to establish a permanent Orchestra with Performance Capabilities of the highest Quality was realized at the first Concerts in October 1891. Thomas served as Music Director until Thomas Death in 1905—just three Weeks after the Dedication of Orchestra Hall, the Orchestra ’s permanent Home designed by Daniel Burnham. Frederick Stock, recruited by Thomas to the Viola Section in 1895, became assistant Conductor in 1899, and succeeded the Orchestra ’s Founder. His Tenure lasted thirty - seven Years, from 1905 to 1942—the longest of the Orchestra ’s Music Directors. Dynamic and innovative, the Stock Years saw the Founding of the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, the first Training Orchestra in the United States affiliated with a major Symphony Orchestra, in 1919. Stock also established Youth Auditions, organized the first Subscription Concerts especially for Children, and began a Series of popular Concerts. Three distinguished Conductors headed the Orchestra during the following Decade: Désiré Defauw was Music Director from 1943 to 1947; Artur Rodzinski assumed the Post in 1947–48; and Rafael Kubelík led the Ensemble for three Seasons from 1950 to 1953. The next ten Years belonged to Fritz Reiner, whose Recordings with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra are still considered Performance Hallmarks. It was Reiner who invited Margaret Hillis to form the Chicago Symphony Chorus in 1957. For the five Seasons from 1963 to 1968, Jean Martinon held the Position of Music Director. Sir Georg Solti, the Orchestra ’s eighth Music Director, served from 1969 until 1991. Georg Solti then held the Title of Music Director Laureate and returned to conduct the Orchestra for several Weeks each Season until Georg Solti Death in September 1997. Solti ’s Arrival launched one of the most successful musical Partnerships of our Time, and the Cso made its first overseas Tour to Europe in 1971 under Cso Direction, along with numerous Award - winning Recordings. Daniel Barenboim was named Music Director designate in January 1989, and Daniel Barenboim became the Orchestra ’s ninth Music Director in September 1991, a Position Daniel Barenboim held until June 2006. His Tenure was distinguished by the Opening of Symphony Center in 1997, highly praised operatic Productions at Orchestra Hall, numerous Appearances with the Orchestra in the dual Role of Pianist and Conductor, twenty - one international Tours, and the Appointment of Duain Wolfe as the Chorus ’s second Director. From 2006 to 2010, Bernard Haitink held the Post of principal Conductor, the first in Cso History. Pierre Boulez. could remember a Time when simply \" getting through \" the Music as best as possible was the Standard. Combined with the wider Audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed Focus on particular Star Conductors and on a high Standard of orchestral Execution.

Other Instruments such as the and may sometimes be grouped into a fifth Section such as a or may stand alone, as may the and electric and electronic Instruments. The Orchestra, depending on the Size, contains almost all of the standard Instruments in each Group. In the History of the Orchestra, its Instrumentation has been expanded over Time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical Period and Ludwig Van Beethoven's Influence on the classical Model. In the 20th and 21st Century, new Repertory Demands expanded the Instrumentation of the Orchestra, resulting in a flexible Use of the classical - Model Instruments and newly developed and in various Combinations. The Terms and may be used to distinguish different Ensembles from the same Locality, such as the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

The Concertmaster leads the pre - concert and handles musical Aspects of Orchestra Management, such as determining the Bowings for the Violins or for all of the String Section. The Concertmaster usually sits to the Conductor's left, closest to the Audience. There is also a principal second Violin, a principal Viola, a principal Cello and a principal Bass. The principal Trombone is considered the Leader of the low Brass Section, while the principal Trumpet is generally considered the Leader of the entire Brass Section. While the Oboe often provides the Tuning Note for the Orchestra ( due to 300-year - old Convention ), there is generally no designated Principal of the Woodwind Section ( though in Woodwind Ensembles, the Flute is often considered the Leader. ) Instead, each Principal confers with the Others as Equals in the Case of musical Differences. an Ad Become a Member Manage your Subscription Access E - edition Order Magazines Email Newsletters Charleston Area Newsletters Columbia Area Newsletters Greenville Area Newsletters Myrtle Beach Area Newsletters Google Tag Manager Enabled of 3 Spoleto Festival Director of Orchestral Activities and Resident Conductor John Kennedy leads the Spoleto Festival Usa Orchestra.

This Year, as always, the Orchestra Players have many Opportunities to perform. They take the Stage in two big Concerts that feature the Orchestra: the Classical Showcase Concert at the Dock Street Theatre on May 28, a Program of Classical and Neo - Classical Works conducted by Michelle Rofrano; and a traditional Concert Hall Performance at the Gaillard Center on June 1, for which Evan Rogister will conduct Works by Prokofiev and Shostakovich.

Boron is used in Pyrotechnics and Flares to produce a green Color. Boron has also been used in some Rockets as an Ignition Source. Boron-10, one of the naturally occurring of Boron, is a good Absorber of and is used in the Control Rods of nuclear Reactors, as a Radiation Shield and as a Neutron Detector. Boron Filaments are used in the Aerospace Industry because of their high - Strength and lightweight. Boron forms several commercially important Compounds. The most important Boron Compound is Sodium Borate Pentahydrate ( Na O ). Large Amounts of this Compound are used in the Manufacture of Fiberglass Insulation and Sodium Perborate Bleach. The second most important Compound is Boric Acid ( H ), which is used to manufacture Textile Fiberglass and is used in Cellulose Insulation as a Flame Retardant. Sodium Borate Decahydrate ( Na O ), better known as Borax, is the third most important Boron Compound. Borax is used in Laundry Products and as a mild antiseptic.

Oganov “ This Work is a beautiful Example of Cooperation between Theory and Experiment, ” said Aitor Bergara, a Physicist at the University of the Basque Country in Spain. Dr. Bergara was not involved with the Research, which was published online by the Journal Nature. Boron has a long History. Mentions of Boron Compounds like Borax Date back Millennia. In 1808, within a Week and a Half of each other, two Research Efforts, led by the great Chemists Sir Humphrey Davy in London and Joseph Louis Gay - Lussac and Louis - Jacques Thénard in Paris, announced that they had isolated Boron. They had not. Another great Chemist, Henri Moissan, later showed that the two earlier Groups had made a Compound consisting of 60 Percent Boron. Moissan also claimed to have isolated Boron. Henri Moissan too was wrong, although Henri Moissan did do better: a Compound with 90 Percent Boron. Not until 1909 was a Sample of 99 Percent pure Boron produced. Just as pure Carbon can come as Diamond or Graphite, Boron comes in multiple Forms  as many as 16 have been reported. But even tiny Amounts of Impurities can alter the Structure, and it seems that the Element has only four pure Forms, Dr. Oganov said. One, known as Alpha Boron, is a dark but transparent Red. Beta Boron is black and looks like Coal. Even Today, Scientists do not definitively know which of these two Forms is the stable Form. ( It is probably beta Boron. ) The third Form is a horrendously complicated Structure known as T-192. The fourth Form is the newly discovered one. Boron ’s unusual Properties come from the three Electrons in its outer electronic Layer. For similar Elements like Aluminum, one Row down on the periodic Table, the three outer Electrons are easily torn away, and the Element behaves as a Metal. But Boron is smaller, and so its Nucleus holds on to the Electrons tighter, more like an Insulator. A Sample of the new Kind of Boron, which measures 0.4 Millimeters across. Vladimir L.

The Outcome is Something horribly complicated. ” Two of the Collaborators on the, Jiuhua Chen of Florida International University and Vladimir L. Solozhenko of the National Council for Scientific Research in France, independently produced the new Boron Phase in high - Temperature, high - Pressure Experiments in 2004. But they were not able to deduce what exactly they had produced. For that, they turned to Dr. Oganov, who employed a computational Technique that encodes Parameters of the crystal Structure in a String. recognized in the hot Springs ( ) near, Italy, and became known as, with primarily medical Uses. The rare Mineral is called, which is found at Sasso,. Sasso was the main Source of Borax from 1827 to 1872, when Sources replaced it. Boron Compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in Volume at low Cost. Boron was not recognized as an Element until it was isolated by Sir and by Joseph Louis Gay - Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard In 1808 Davy observed that electric Current sent through a Solution of Borates produced a brown Precipitate on one of the Electrodes. In Davy subsequent Experiments, Davy used Potassium to reduce Boric Acid instead of. Davy produced enough Boron to confirm a new Element and named the Element Gay - Lussac and Thénard used Iron to reduce Boric Acid at high Temperatures. By oxidizing Boron with Air, they showed that Boric Acid is an Oxidation Product of Boron. Jöns Jacob Berzelius identified Boron as an Element in 1824. Pure Boron was arguably first produced by the American Chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909. Preparation of elemental Boron in the Laboratory The earliest Routes to elemental Boron involved the Reduction of with Metals such as or. However, the Product is almost always contaminated with of those Metals. Pure Boron can be prepared by reducing volatile Boron Halides with at high Temperatures. Ultrapure Boron for Use in the Semiconductor Industry is produced by the Decomposition of at high Temperatures and then further purified by the or The Production of Boron Compounds does not involve the Formation of elemental Boron, but exploits the convenient Availability of Borates. Main Article: Allotropes of Boron Boron is similar to in its Capability to form stable molecular Networks. Even nominally disordered ( ) Boron contains regular Boron which are, however, bonded randomly to each other without Boron is a very hard, black Material with a Melting Point of above 2000 ° C. It forms four major: Α - rhombohedral and Β - rhombohedral ( Α - R and Β - R ), Γ and Β - tetragonal ( Β - T ); Α. Boron on the Periodic Table Boron Uses and Properties Discoverers of Boron Discoverers of Boron Three Scientists contributed to the Discovery of Boron. In 1808 three Scientists announced the Discovery of Boron. Two Scientists from France Joseph - Louis Gay - Lussac and Louis Jaques Thenard and a English Chemist Sir Humphry Davy had been working on the Discovery of Boron. They all discovered Boron through a simple Test. They isolated Boron by taking Boric Acid and combining it with Potassium to isolate Boron. Today the same Method is used to extract impure Boron which is very common ( Boron is rarely found in it's pure Form ). Above are the Scientists credited with the Discovery of Boron. Carbon ( middle ) when combined with Boric Acid ( right ) isolates the Element Boron. Designed by",

From the Arabic Word and the Persian Word, which are both Words for the Material \" Borax. \" Boron is pronounced as History and Uses Boron was discovered by Joseph - Louis Gay - Lussac and Louis - Jaques Thénard, French Chemists, and independently by Sir Humphry Davy, an English Chemist, in 1808. They all isolated Boron by combining Boric Acid ( H ) with. Today, Boron is obtained by heating Borax ( Na O ) with, although other Methods are used if high - Purity Boron is required. Boron is used in Pyrotechnics and Flares to produce a green Color. Boron has also been used in some Rockets as an Ignition Source. Boron-10, one of the naturally occurring of Boron, is a good Absorber of and is used in the Control Rods of nuclear Reactors, as a Radiation Shield and as a Neutron Detector. Boron Filaments are used in the Aerospace Industry because of their high - Strength and lightweight. Boron forms several commercially important Compounds. The most important Boron Compound is Sodium Borate Pentahydrate ( Na O ). Large Amounts of this Compound are used in the Manufacture of Fiberglass Insulation and Sodium Borate ( Borax ) is used as a Water Softener. Boron is also used in the Manufacture of Borosilicate Glass, which is used in Laboratory Equipment and in the Manufacture of Py",
