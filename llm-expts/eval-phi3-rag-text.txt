Which is the Cinema ID for Amélie?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Moment when I had the faintest Impression that there is Something wrong or inappropriate in Audrey Tautou Acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with Nino Quincampoix Talent. Most of the Actors have done a wonderful Job, although I want to mention the Scene when Amélie's Mother gets Amélie nervous Breakdown because of the suicidal Fish. This Scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme Close - Up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in Disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the Director's Choice, so I do n't hold Yolande Moreau responsible for that. Another negative and distracting Thing where some Scenes when Jean - Pierre Jeunet decided to show the Key in Amélie's Pocket after copying it and bringing the original Key back to the Grocer's Door in a very unrealistic Way. Key uses a digital Effet showing the Key's Silhouette in a yellow Light. This is a Technique that has n't been used very often in the Film, except for showing Amélie's Heart going faster and the old, blind Man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these Scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful Cinematography. There could have been other Ways to communicate the Actions. A simple Smile on the old's Man Face, a Close - Up of Amélie's Hand letting the copied key Slide into Amélie Pocket and the Heart beat as a Background Sound would have done the same without disturbing the Atmosphere. Anyway, Le fabuleux Destin D'amélie Poulain is still my favorite Movie. The Narration is perfectly arranged taking its Time to tell every Detail. I enjoyed the Subplots a. de Penguin, the Story of the Old Man and the Heart, the Story of the Fish and the Story of the Key. The Story of the Key is the most interesting one. It is a Story of a Key, a Story of a Pocket,

History World History... and beyond Socratic Meta Featured Answers Topics How do you calculate the mass Defect for C-14? How do you calculate the binding Energy? Answer Truong - Son N. Apr 11, 2018 Well, you take the theoretical Mass of combining all the Particles, and subtract from it the actual isotopic Mass. That Mass accounts for the binding Energy. # M_p = " 1.00727647 Amu / Proton " # # M_n = " 1.00866492 Amu / Neutron " # # m_e = 5.48530 xx 10^(-4 ) " Amu / Electron " # # M_(""^(14 ) " C " ) = " 14.003241989 Amu / Atom " # There. observed Mass ( U ) = 12.000 14.003 Mass Defect ( U ) = 12.09894 - 12.000 14.11627 - 14.003 = 0.09894 U = 0.11327 U Mass Defect ( Kg ) 0.09894 × 1.6608 × 10 0.11327 × 1.6608 × 10 = 1.643 × 10 Kg = 1.881 × 10 Kg binding Energy ( J ) 1.643 × 10 × ( 3 × 10 1.881 × 10 × ( 3 × 10 11 ) = 1.881 × 10 12 J = 1.881 × 10 12 J = 1.881 ×

Who is the spouse of the bride?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Translation, of the Bridegroom commonly accepted to be Jesus Christ. The Bridegroom is also mentioned in the Parable of the Ten Virgins " Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten Virgins who took their Lamps and went out to meet the Bridegroom. " Mentions of the Bride The Book of Revelation repeatedly mentions the Appearance of the Bride. And I John saw the Holy City, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for Jesus Christ Husband.... And there came unto me one of the seven Angels which had the seven Vials full of the seven last Plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the Bride, the Lamb's Wife. And Plagues carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high Mountain, and shewed me that great City, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of Heaven from God, In the above Passages,, the Author of the Book of Revelation, speaks of seeing the Bride revealed and refers to Plagues as the, first mentioned in And the Spirit and the Bride say, " Come. " And let Plagues that heareth say, " Come. " And let Plagues that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let Plagues take the Water of Life freely. Note - The Greek Word for Bride is Νύμφη ( Nymfi or Numphe ) as in Revelation 21:2, 9, ( Cf., 18:23; 22:17 ). This Word, Νύμφη, is understood to mean " a Son's Wife, " or " Daughter - in - Law, " -"bride. " Revelation 19:7 which has Γυνὴ ( Gune ) means " Wife " or " Woman ". The Context of Revelation 19:7 is Marriage so this should inform the Reader that the Bride is a Woman. The Bride is also mentioned in the Book of Ephesians 5:22-33. The Bride is also mentioned in the Book of 1 Corinthians 6:

Tea with Glenda Jackson, an Actress I ’ve admired since watching “ A Touch of Class ” on Tv with my Mother as a Teenager, turned out not to be the Dream Encounter this Fan imagined. The 81-year - old English Actress, making a triumphant Return to Broadway in Edward Albee ’s “ Three Tall Women, ” seemed friendly enough when we exchanged Greetings at an Upper East Side Café. But Edward Albee went into Battle Mode once the Tape Recorder was switched on. Jackson ’s clipped Replies and occasional Pounding of the Table with Jackson Hands made me wonder if this Labour Party Stalwart had mistaken me for the Conservative Opposition. Her Default Position of peremptory Bewilderment — “ I have no Idea what you ’re asking me ” — was perplexing. My Questions about Jackson Reemergence on Stage after Jackson long Break from acting to serve as a Member of Parliament seemed to me fairly straightforward and innocuous. I had come to worship Jackson, not to grill Jackson . I left expertly filleted by that Trademark Voice Jackson still wields like a Scalpel. Time has reinterpreted Jackson ’s stern Beauty so that Beauty Face now resembles a Francis Bacon Painting. Jackson ’s Acting Career and Political Career have been inextricably intertwined. Jackson ’s Political Career began in 1974 when she was elected to the London Borough of Hampst

What is Rama and who follows it?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Rama and the Ramayana: Lessons in Dharma Developed by Jean Johnson, New York University. The Ramayana Story is one of the two great Indian Epics. The Tells about Life in India around 1000 Bce and offers Models in Dharma. The Hero, Rama, lived Rama whole Life by the Rules of Dharma; in Fact, that was why Indian consider Rama heroic. When Rama was a young Boy, Boy was the perfect Son. Later Son was an ideal Husband to Son faithful Wife, Sita, and a responsible Ruler of Aydohya. " Be as Rama, " young Indians have been taught for 2,000 Years; " Be as Sita. " Prince Rama was the eldest of four Sons and was to become King when King Father retired from ruling. His Stepmother, however, wanted to see King Son Bharata, Rama's younger Brother, become King. Remembering that the King had once promised to grant Rama any two Wishes Rama desired, Rama demanded that Rama be banished and Bharata be crowned. The King had to keep Rama Word to Rama Wife and ordered Rama's Banishment. Rama accepted the Decree unquestioningly. " I gladly obey Father's Command, " Rama said to Rama Stepmother. " Why, I would go even if you ordered it. " When Sita, Rama's Wife, heard Rama was to be banished, Rama begged to accompany Rama to Rama Forest Retreat. " As Shadow to Substance, so Wife to Husband, " Rama reminded Rama. " Is not the Wife's Dharma to be at Rama Husband's Side? Let me walk ahead of you so that I may smooth the Path for your Feet, " Rama pleaded. Rama agreed, and Rama, Sita and Sita Brother, Lakshmana, set out for Rama Forest Retreat. Rama and Sita were married in Rama Forest Retreat. Rama and Sita lived happily in Rama Forest Retreat for 14 Years

Which is the decay mode for uranium-238?.You can only use this specified context for answering: a 1:1 Neutron: Proton Ratio. The heaviest Elements such as Lead have close to 1.5 Neutrons per Proton(e.g. 1.536 in ). No Nuclide heavier than lead-208 is stable; these heavier Elements have to shed Mass to achieve Stability, most usually as. The other common Decay Method for Isotopes with a high Neutron to proton Ratio ( N / P ) is, in which the Nuclide changes elemental Identity while keeping the same Mass and lowering its N / P Ratio. For some Isotopes with a relatively low N / P Ratio, there is an inverse Beta Decay, by which a Proton is transformed into a Neutron, thus moving towards a stable Isotope; however, since Fission almost always produces Products which are Neutron Heavy, is relatively rare compared to Electron Emission. There are many relatively short Beta Decay Chains, at least two ( a heavy, beta Decay and a Light, Decay ) for every discrete Weight up to around 207 and some beyond, but for the higher Mass Elements ( Isotopes heavier than Lead ) there are only four Pathways which encompass all decay Chains. This is because there are just two main Decay Methods:, which reduces the Mass by 4 atomic Mass Units ( Amu ), and Beta, which does not change the atomic Mass at all ( just the atomic Number and the P / N Ratio ). The four Paths are termed 4n, 4n + 1, 4n + 2, and 4n + 3; the Remainder from dividing the atomic Mass by four gives the Chain the Isotope will use to decay. There are other Decay Modes, but they invariably occur at a lower Probability than Alpha or Beta Decay. ( It should not be supposed that these Chains are the only possible decay Chains for a given Isotope; they are just the most common Chains. )

Jail Populations are typically higher in the Summer than Winter. The Bjs adjusted its Estimates for 2015 and 2016 to account for seasonal Variation and make Year - to - Year Comparisons possible. For both Years, the Difference among Women between the previously published Yearend Populations and the new adjusted Midyear Populations was about 5 %, or about 5,000 Women.

When does helium-4 decay?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Helium's Chemical Inertness ( the most extreme of all the Elements ), and also the Lack of Interaction of Helium Atoms with each other ( producing the lowest Melting and boiling Points of all the Elements ). In a similar Way, the particular energetic Stability of the Helium-4 Nucleus, produced by similar Effects, accounts for the Ease of Helium-4 Production in atomic Reactions involving both heavy - Particle Emission and Fusion. Some stable Helium-3 is produced in Fusion Reactions from Hydrogen, but it is a very small Fraction, compared with the highly energetically favorable Production of Helium-4. The Stability of Helium-4 is the Reason that Hydrogen is converted to Helium-4, and not Deuterium ( Hydrogen-2 ) or Helium-3 or other heavier Elements during Fusion Reactions in the Sun. It is also partly responsible for the Alpha Particle being by far the most common Type of baryonic Particle to be ejected from an atomic Nucleus; in other Words, is far more common than Binding Energy per Nucleon of common Isotopes. The binding Energy per Particle of Helium-4 is significantly larger than all nearby Nuclides. The unusual Stability of the Helium-4 Nucleus is also important cosmologically. It explains the Fact that, in the first few Minutes after the, as the " Soup " of free Protons and Neutrons which had initially been created in about a 6:1 Ratio cooled to the Point where nuclear Binding was possible, almost all atomic Nuclei to form were Helium-4 Nuclei. The Binding of the Nucleons in Helium-4 is so tight that its Production consumed nearly all the free Neutrons in a few Minutes, before they could beta decay, and left very few to form heavier Atoms ( especially, and ). The Energy of Helium-4 Production is so great that it is the main source of the Sun's Energy. The Sun's Energy is produced by the Fusion of Hydrogen into Helium-4. The Sun's Energy is produced by the Fusion

Which are the programming paradigm of logic programming?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Mary = John.

Businesses that have a wide Target Market will focus on a specific Target Audience for certain Messages to send, such as The Body Shops Mother's Day Advertisements, which were aimed at the Children and Spouses of Women, rather than the whole Market which would have included the Women themselves. A Target Audience is formed from the same Factors as a Target Market, but it is more specific, and is susceptible to Influence from other Factors. An Example of this was the Marketing of the Usda's Food Guide, which was intended to appeal to young People between the Ages of 2 and 18. The Factors they had to consider outside of the standard Marketing Mix included the nutritional Needs of growing Children, Children's Knowledge and Attitudes regarding Nutrition, and other specialized Details. This reduced their Target Market and provided a specific Target Audience to focus on. Common Factors for Target Audiences may reduce the Target Market to Specifics such as' Men aged 20–30 Years old, living in Auckland, New Zealand' rather than' Men aged 20–30 Years old'. However, just because a Target Audience is specialized does n't mean the Message being delivered will not be of Interest and received by those outside the intended demographic. Failures of targeting a specific Audience are also possible, and occur when Information is incorrectly conveyed.

WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE CAUSE OF NOODLE.You can only use this specified context for answering: Cyclists. And because Americans are among the least avid Cyclists in the World, they ’re among the most likely to get killed by a Car But I ’ve discovered a Life - saving Device that allows Cyclists to protect themselves and take back the Road: the Pool Noodle. Find one for about $ 2 anywhere: Dollar Stores, Shopping Malls, even the Supermarket. Choose from the Array of Fun Colors and use a Bungee Cord to Strap this Light, flexible Toy to your Bike Rack so that it sticks out to the left Side ( or the right Side, if you ’re in a Country where Cars drive on the Left ). Start pedaling and watch as Car after Car moves over to the other Lane. The Pool Noodle may look silly, but since strapping it on our Loads, it has made our Lives safer every Day. ( Plus, it ’s a Fun Conversation Starter at Pitstops, and it also reminds us not to take Life too seriously. ) On Roads with zero Road Shoulder, the Pool noodle our Shoulder. It makes us more visible to passing Cars and the 18-wheelers that used to skim us constantly. The Pool Noodle is also a Tool for Advocacy. To every other Vehicle on the Road, that $ 2 Piece of Foam visualizes what the minimum three Feet of safe Passing Distance looks like that is our legal Right in more than 30 States in the Us. As more urban Dwellers take up Cycling, think of the Attention we can bring to sharing the Road if we all strapped a Pool Noodle to the Back of our Bicycles. Of course, the Pool Noodle is not a Substitute for the Helmet. While the Helmet protects your Head just in Case you fall, the Pool Noodle lowers the Chances of that potential Accident being caused by a Car — and a Lot of Calamity can be Avoided by a Simple, Low-Cost Device.

What is the ultimate cause of noodle?

Which is the cipM poet ID of John Cage?.You can only use this specified context for answering: , and 4 Units respectively. Each Unit contains 16 Bars, and is divided the same Way: 4 Bars, 3 Bars, 2 Bars, etc. Finally, the musical Content of the Piece is based on sixteen Motives. Such " nested Proportions ", as Cage called them, became a regular Feature of Cage Music throughout the 1940s. The Technique was elevated to great Complexity in later Pieces such as Sonatas and Interludes for prepared Piano ( 1946–48 ), in which many Proportions used non - integer Numbers ( 1¼, ¾, 1¼, ¾, 1½, and 1½ for, for Example ), or, a Song for Voice and closed Piano, in which two Sets of Proportions are used simultaneously. In late 1940s, Cage started developing further Methods of breaking away with traditional Harmony. For Instance, in String Quartet in Four Parts ( 1950 ) Cage first composed a Number of: Chords with fixed Instrumentation. The Piece progresses from one to another. In each Instance the was selected only based on whether it contains the Note necessary for the Melody, and so the Rest of the Notes do not form any directional Harmony. Concerto for prepared Piano ( 1950–51 ) used a System of Charts of Durations, Dynamics, Melodies, etc., from which Cage would choose using simple geometric Patterns. The last Movement of the Concerto was a Step towards using Chance Procedures, which Cage adopted soon afterwards. I Ching Divination involves obtaining a Hexagram by random Generation ( such as tossing Coins ), then reading the Chapter associated with that Hexagram. A Chart System was also used ( along with nested Proportions ) for the large Piano Work Music of Changes ( 1951 ), which was composed using the I Ching. The Technique was further developed in the Piano Music Composition with 49 Events ( 1952 ), in which the Composer would write down a list of Events ( such as

A Colony of Clostridium Botulinum under high Magnification. Article Start When a Team of California Researchers reported a new Type of Botulinum Toxin in 2013, they withheld genetic Data on the lethal Toxin out of Concern that Malefactors could use the Data to make the Toxin before an effective Antitoxin could be developed. The Report stirred considerable Interest. It was not only the first Report of a novel Botulinum Toxin in more than 40 Years, but it was also a rare Example of Researchers taking the Initiative to limit Publication of Data out of Concern about potential " dual Use " of their Findings. But last Week it came to light that the novel Toxin is n't quite the Threat it was described as. Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( Cdc ) and the University of Wisconsin ( Uw ), writing in the Journal of Infectious Diseases ( Jid ), said it turns out that the novel Toxin can be blocked by available Antitoxins after all. That suggests that it is n't really a novel Toxin, the Authors said. In a Commentary accompanying the new Report, Paul Keim, Ph.D., of Northern Arizona University, said the new Toxin is " a variant of the well-known Type E Botulinum Toxin." The new Toxin is " a variant of the well-known Type

Which animal species can hear the lowest frequencies?.You can only use this specified context for answering: different Authors, under different experimental Conditions, using Individuals drawn from different Stocks, thus increasing the Degree of Confidence of the Data. Diagram from http://www.onlinezoologists.com/cs/node/21 by Wesley R. Elsbury. Odontocetes, like Bats, are excellent Echolocators, capable of producing, perceiving, and analyzing ultrasonic Frequencies. In general, Odontocetes have a Hearing Bandwidth of 100 Hz to 180 Khz, with the most sensitive Hearing in the high - Frequency Range of 10 Khz to 65 Khz where their Hearing Threshold is 45 to 55 Db Re 1 Μpa. In the low Frequencies below 1 Khz where Airgun Sound is concentrated, toothed Whales have a very high Hearing Threshold of 80 to 130 Db Re 1 Μpa. ( see Geo Expro Vol.7, No. 4 for an Explanation of this Terminology ) There is, however, considerable Variability within and among Species. Sperm Whales, beaked Whales and Dolphins are said to sense sound from 75 - 100 Hz if loud enough. Dolphins are renowned for their acute Hearing Sensitivity, especially in the Frequency Range 5 to 50 Khz. Several Species have hearing Thresholds between 30 and 50 Db Re 1 Μpa in this Frequency Range. The Killer Whale has a sound Pressure Level Threshold of 26 Db Re 1 μPa @ 15 Khz. Mysticetes have a very different Hearing Capability compared to toothed Whales. Due to their immense Size, these Mammals can not be kept in Captivity for Study like toothed Whales. Little Information exists on their Hearing and Echolocation Capabilities. However, it is known that Mysticetes have a Hearing Bandwidth of 100 Hz to 180 Khz, with the most sensitive Hearing in the low Frequency

TheHandmaiden is a Masterpiece in pretty much every Sense. It is visually exquisite, Costumes, Production Design, Cinematography, Music, all combine to create a lush Vision of Japan - occupied Korea in the 1930s. Park Chan - Wook is a visually meticulous Filmmaker and no Film so far of Park Chan - Wook has showcased Park Chan - Wook Knack for visual Storytelling better than the Handmaiden. I went into this Film totally blind, which I honestly recommend all People doing, because the Plot itself unfolds in such a beautifully engineered Fashion. My best Description of the Film is a Rebecca - like Hitchcockian Thriller with the Extremity and Depravity of Films like Oldboy and Battle Royale, and the humanistic Sexuality of Blue is the Warmest Colour. All Actors are stunning in this Film. The two Women share an honest, tender Romance that is both passionate and moving, with a refreshing Candour about the Nature of Sexuality that is almost never seen in Hollywood Productions. The Count is an incredibly charismatic Performer who remains appealing despite Performer many despicable Acts. But as always with a Park Chan - Wook Film, the Actors are not the Point, but the Story and the Visuals. The Handmaiden is a Masterpiece in every Sense. It is visually exquisite, Costumes, Production Design, Cinematography, Music

Dept. of Earth and Planetary Sciences plays an important Role in the Equilibria and Kinetics of Processes controlling the Compositions of Soilwaters and Groundwaters, the Fate of Contaminants in Groundwaters, and the Subsurface Storage of Co and nuclear Waste. Over the last several Decades, many Dozens of individual experimental Studies have addressed Aspects of Surface that have contributed to an increased Understanding of its Role in natural Systems. However, there has been no previous Attempt to develop a Model of Surface that can be used to link all the experimental Studies in Order to place them on a predictive Basis. Overall, my Research has successfully integrated the Results of the Work of many Experimentalists published over several Decades. For the first Time in Studies of the Geochemistry of the Mineral - Water Interface, a practical predictive Capability for Modeling has become available. The predictive Correlations developed in my Research now enable Extrapolations of experimental Studies to provide Estimates of Surface Chemistry for Systems not yet studied experimentally and for natural and anthropogenically perturbed Systems.

Eventually, some 38,000 square Miles of Cherokee Land in Kentucky was ceded to Great Britain and the United States. After the British arrived on the present Site of Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, there was continuous Contact with Cherokee in Kentucky as Traders strengthened their Alliances and worked their Way into the Appalachian Mountains. Perhaps the earliest Evidence of an English Trader with Cherokee in Kentucky is in Wolfe County, where a Date of 1717 occurs with traditional Symbols of Anitsisqua, the Cherokee Bird Clan, incised on a sandstone Outcrop overlooking Panther Branch.

The Treaty of Greenville, negotiated in Ohio on August 3, 1795, ended the War between the United States and the Confederacy.

The Role of the Peasants The first Characteristic to be noted here is that the Peasantry did not constitute a strategic Factor of any Significance in the revolutionary Process.

Name an academic major that starts with the letter E.You can only use this specified context for answering: “ Breaks ” after D♯, and then resumes. In Tenor Clef, there is no Break, but F♯ and G♯ appear in the lower Octave instead of the upper Octave. The Order of the Flats is the Opposite of the Order of the Sharps: B, E, A, D, G, C, F. This makes the Order of Flats and Sharps Palindromes. The Order of Flats can be remembered with this Mnemonic: Birds Eat and Dive Going Crazy Far. The Flats always make a perfect Zig - Zag Pattern, alternating going up and down, regardless of Clef, as seen in There are easy Ways to remember which key Signature belongs to which major Scale. In sharp key Signatures, the last sharp is a half - Step below the Tonic ( the first Note of a Scale ). shows a few sharp key Signatures in different Clefs: Three different sharp key Signatures in Treble, Bass, and Alto Clefs The first key Signature in is in treble Clef. The last sharp ( in this Case the only sharp ), F♯, is a half - Step below the Note G. Therefore, this is the key Signature of G Major. The second key Signature in is in Bass Clef. The last sharp, G♯, is a half - Step below the Note A. Therefore, this is the key Signature of A Major. The third key Signature in is in Alto Clef.

What develops from gynoecium?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Km. 9.6 Libramiento Norte, Carretera Irapuato - León, Cp 36821 Irapuato, Gto, Mexico. Electronic Address: Sdfolter@langebio.cinvestav.mx. Pmid: 26799132 Doi: 10.1016 / J.pbi.2015.12.006 Abstract Flowering Plants are called Angiosperms and most of their Flowers produce at their Center a Pistil or a Gynoecium, which is the female reproductive Structure. After a double Fertilization Event, the Gynoecium develops into a Fruit with great Importance for the Plant because it protects and helps the Dispersion of a new Generation, and, for Humans is a key nutritional Source. Over 20 Years, Arabidopsis Thaliana has been used to discover important Genes for Gynoecium Development, and in the early Years, Auxin was already proposed to play a Role. More recently, new Discoveries are unveiling the Importance of other Hormones, particularly Cytokinins, and providing Insights about the Action of these Hormones in Gynoecium Development, which is the Focus of this Review. One of the next Challenges is to further refine the Knowledge about the Mechanisms by which Hormones shape the Gynoecium, understand the Communication among them and their Interactions with Transcription Factors that altogether guide Gynoecium Development.

In the Mid-1960s, a Phs venereal Disease Investigator in San Francisco named Peter Buxton found out about the Tuskegee Study and expressed Peter Buxton Concerns to Peter Buxton Superiors that it was unethical. In Response, Phs Officials formed a Committee to review the Study but ultimately opted to continue it, with the Goal of tracking the Participants until all had died, Autopsies were performed and the Project Data could be analyzed. As a Result, Buxton leaked the Story to a Reporter Friend, who passed it on to a fellow Reporter, Jean Heller of the Associated Press. Heller broke the Story in July 1972, prompting public Outrage and forcing the Study to shut down. By that Time, 28 Participants had perished from Syphilis, 100 more had passed away from related Complications, at least 40 Spouses had been diagnosed with it and the Disease had been passed to 19 Children at Birth.

The present Translation Rate is found to be typically 100 million Years for the inner Core to be entirely renewed, which is one to two Orders of Magnitude faster than the Growth Rate of the inner Core's Radius. The resulting strong Asymmetry of Buoyancy Flux caused by light Elements is. Melting - induced Stratification above the Earth's inner Core due to convective Transports of light Elements.

In Fact, Servants hauled Water to the House from a Park five City Blocks away and Abigail hung Laundry to dry in what became the East Room! “ We had not the least Fence, Yard or other Convenience without, and the great unfinished Audience Room, I made a Drying Room of — nor were there enough Lusters or Lamps, so Candles were stuck here and there for Light. ” Neither the main Staircase nor the outer Steps were completed, so Abigail and John entered the White House by Means of temporary wooden Stairs and a Platform. But for the three Months John was in the new Capitol City, Abigail duly held the Dinners and Receptions required of Abigail . Monday Night Receptions were open to Everyone and the formal Dinners for Members of Congress were held on Wednesday Evenings. Abigail also planned and hosted one of the first Fourth of July Celebrations in Washington, Dc. Late in John ’s Term as President, John signed the Alien and Sedition Acts. John relied on Abigail for political Advice and as a sounding Board, and signing the Acts was a Move that Abigail vigorously supported. These four Acts placed Restrictions on Aliens who wanted to become Citizens, treated Aliens as Enemies in Times of War, and censured the Press. These Acts were passed in the wake of the French Revolution and the XYZ Affair. The Acts were highly controversial and were later repealed. Abigail was a strong supporter of the Acts and believed that they were

It is important to emphasize that all Communication with the Delegates, from Registration, Booking of Services to Confirmation will be made through the Uea Head Office in Rotterdam, this being so because the only Language used to approach the Delegates is Esperanto. Good Cooperation with an Airline – which might be the national One – could be also welcome. Differences from other Conventions Esperanto Congresses are very specific, differing from usual international Meetings quite significantly. First of all: there is no Need for Interpreters. For the Participants it is one of the main Opportunities to use Esperanto internationally, particularly within their own specific Field of Interest. Contacts are made very easily by Means of the representative Network. The entire List of these is printed in the Uea Yearbook; as well as in the Home Pages of Uea, besides with other important Information on Uea and the Esperanto Movement. Attending the Congress is meant to be a Pleasure, as an integral Part of the general Activity for Esperanto during the Year, and as a Hobby. That is why a Lot of cultural Programs are also included: many Concerts, Theater Plays ( all in Esperanto Language ), and other social Events and Entertainment. The Congress has a very informal Structure and Character. The Delegates usually tour a Lot during, before and after the Congress The sole working Language of the Congress is Esperanto and all Communication with the Participants is in this Language. This includes not only the Speakers and the Proceedings of the Congress, but also guidance on the Tours, Receptionists at Stands, Issues of daily News Etc. Our Delegates usually do not appreciate being approached or helped in English or other Languages than the local Vernacular and Esperanto. General Scheme of meeting Rooms and other Premises: Day 1 Thu Moving in with the Material, 1 Office needed for the Registration, 1 Office for the Welcome, 1 Office for the Welcome, 1 Office for the Welcome, 1 Office for the Welcome, 1 Office for the Welcome, 1 Office for the Welcome, 1 Office

What is the method for Cretaceous -145000000-0-?.You can only use this specified context for answering: the K / Pg Boundary until about 60 Ma. The Prominence of large Teeth in the South Pacific suggests that Ray - finned Fishes explored a novel Community Structure for the first 6–7 million Years of the Paleocene, in which large Teeth were unusually abundant compared with those in Cretaceous and later Paleocene Assemblages. The overall Size Structure of Tooth Assemblages in the later Paleocene and Eocene shows a lower relative Abundance of large Teeth. However, the constant Presence of at least a few Teeth in each Sample that are significantly larger than the largest Cretaceous Teeth ( ) suggests that the Decrease in relative Abundance of large Teeth represents a “ filling in ” of ecological Niche Space between the smallest and largest Tooth Sizes rather than a Disappearance of large - toothed Fishes in later Paleocene and Eocene Fish Assemblages. A major Advantage of our deep - Sea Ichthyolith Records is that they can allow Assessment of Variability in marine Vertebrate Assemblages up to and across major Events. Our Pacific Records show that the latest Cretaceous Vertebrate Community was very stable, both in Terms of the Ratio of Fish to Sharks and the Size Structure of the Tooth Community ( ). Indeed, our South Pacific Record of Tooth / Denticle Ratios and Tooth Size “ flatlines ” for the last 10 million Years of the Cretaceous. The Stability of Cretaceous Assemblages suggests that the Changes observed at the K / Pg Boundary and early Paleocene were abrupt, likely caused by the Extinction Event, and are not Part of a Background Trend or the Result of random Chance. This Change in Fish Community Structure appears to have been caused by the Chicxulub Impact ( ) rather than being a long - Term Evolutionary Trend. The Stability of the Cretaceous Fish Community suggests that the Chicxulub Impact was a major Event that caused a rapid and Abrupt Change in the marine Vertebrate Community. The Ch

In Contrast, electronic Markets, which have been lauded for their Transparency, actually have an Element of Opacity because Trading Firms do not know each other ’s Identity. Market Manipulation and operational Risk While Market Manipulation has always been a Concern in Trading, it may be more difficult to detect Today because Hst Firms trade correlated Products across multiple Asset Classes and Trading Venues around the World. Moreover, Trading Venues may be monitored by different Regulators using different Technologies, such as the Cftc ’s Trade Surveillance System ( Tss)18 and the Sec ’s Market Information Data Analytics System ( MIDAS).19 In Addition to Concerns about the Interoperability of these Systems, it is questionable whether firm - Level Data can be easily exchanged among Regulators because Midas does not provide Attribution Information about the Brokers or Customers behind the orders.20 A recent Example of Regulators and Trading Venues working together to discipline Firms engaged in Market Manipulation is the Case of the Hst Firm, Panther Energy Trading. In July 2013, the Cftc fined Panther for manipulating U.s. Commodities Markets and the United Kingdom ’s Financial Conduct Authority fined the Owner of Panther for manipulating Markets there. Public Policy Questions Among the many Questions Hst raises for Policymakers and Regulators are the following: • Are Market Participants underpricing the Risks of Hst? • Do they have the real - Time Controls they need to manage these Risks? • Should Trading Venues evaluate alternative Revenue Models? • Do Regulators and Trading Venues have the proper Incentives and Tools to identify and control Market Manipulation? • Should Regulators and Trading Venues work together to discipline Firms engaged in Market Manipulation? • Should Regulators and Trading Venues work together to discipline Firms engaged in Market Manipulation? • Should Reg

Tell me phase change whose name has the word sublimation in it..You can only use this specified context for answering: In ( B ), the Particles are a Gas, and most of the Volume is actually empty Space. The Particles are not to scale; in Reality, the Dots representing the Particles would be about 1/100th the Size as depicted. Under some Circumstances, the solid Phase can transition directly to the Gas Phase without going through a liquid Phase, and a Gas can directly become a solid. The solid - to - Gas Change is called, while the reverse Process is called. Sublimation is isothermal, like the other Phase Changes. There is a measurable Energy Change during Sublimation; this Energy Change is called the Enthalpy of Sublimation, represented as Δ. The Relationship between the Δ and the other Enthalpy Changes is as follows: = Δ As such, Δ is not always tabulated because it can be simply calculated from Δ and Δ There are several common Examples of Sublimation. A well - known Product — dry Ice — is actually solid Co. Dry Ice is dry because it sublimes, with the solid bypassing the liquid Phase and going straight to the Gas Phase. The Sublimation occurs at Temperature of −77 ° C, so it must be handled with Caution. If you have ever noticed that Ice Cubes in a Freezer tend to get smaller over Time, it is because the solid Water is very slowly subliming. “ Freezer Burn ” is n’t actually a Burn; it occurs when certain Foods, such as Meats, slowly lose solid Water Content because of Sublimation. The Food is still good but looks unappetizing. Reducing the Temperature of a Freezer will slow the Sublimation of solid Water. Chemical Equations can be used to represent a Phase Change. In such Cases, it is crucial to use Phase Labels on the Substances. For Example, the Chemical Equation for the Melting of Ice is: H2O(s) → H2O(l) The Phase Labels are ( s ) for Solid and ( l ) for Liquid. The Chemical Equation for the Sublimation of Dry Ice

Different Cultures and Countries contributed to the Movement during the 1960s and 70s Roy Lichtenstein 1963 Tate © Estate of Roy Lichtenstein Emerging in the mid 1950s in Britain and late 1950s in America, Pop Art reached its Peak in the 1960s. It began as a Revolt against the dominant Approaches to Art and Culture and traditional Views on what Art should be. Young Artists felt that what they were taught at Art School and what they saw in Museums did not have Anything to do with their Lives or the Things they saw around them every Day. Instead they turned to Sources such as Hollywood Movies, Advertising, Product Packaging, Pop Music and comic Books for their Imagery. In 1957 Pop Artist listed the ‘ Characteristics of Pop Art ’ in a Letter to Roy Lichtenstein Emerging Friends the Architects Peter and Alison Smithson: Pop Art is: Popular ( designed for a mass Audience ), Transient ( short - Term Solution ), Expendable ( easily forgotten ), Low Cost, Mass produced, Young ( aimed at Youth ), Witty, Sexy, Gimmicky, Glamorous, Big Business Critics were horrified by the Pop Artists ’ Use of such ‘ low ’ subject Matter and by their apparently uncritical Treatment of it.

Pop Art was a Movement that was very much about the Artist’s View of the World and the Artist’s Role in it. Pop Artists were very much concerned

Typically, an Inspector will manually examine or " palpate " the front Legs of a Horse to see if the Horse reacts in Pain and to look for other Abnormalities. Horses born after October 1, 1975 are also subject to what is know as the " Scar Rule ": Their Legs should show no Evidence of Scarring that is indicative of soring, such as missing Hair,. ( as well as in Transport to these Venues ) Intimidation, Harassment and Threats from Industry Participants have kept Inspectors from examining Horses outside of a designated Inspection Area, directly before entering the Show Ring. This System gives Trainers ample Opportunities to attempt to conceal Soring before the Horse is inspected. In an Effort to mask Soring, some Trainers will apply numbing Agents to their Horses' Legs prior to Inspection so the Horse wo n't react. Others " Steward " their Horses at Home, putting them through mock Inspections wherein if the Horse reacts to Palpation, Law is beaten with a Whip, Bat or other blunt Instrument. The Horse learns to be more fearful of the Beating than the Pain in Instrument Legs and learns to stand quietly. Other Trainers will attach Alligator Clips and other Pain - inducing Objects to sensitive Parts of the Horse prior to Inspection, causing Instrument to focus on the new Source of Pain rather than Instrument.

What does manure produce as a by-product?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Bedding, spilled Feed, and a Variety of other Substances. Most Livestock - associated organic by - Products are Animal Manures. The Amount and Consistency of Manures varies with Animal Type, Climate, Feed Ration, Animal Age and Health, and other Factors. To compare Manure Production between Animal Types or between Animals of the same Type, Manure Production is expressed in Terms of 1,000-pound Animal Units. For Reference, a single Dairy Cow weighs about 1,400 Pounds, or 1.4 Animal Units. A typical Steer weighs about 1,000 Pounds, or 1 Animal Unit, and most Hogs weigh between 200 and 300 Pounds, or 0.2 to 0.3 Animal Unit. A mature Broiler, on the other Hand, weighs between 4 and 5 Pounds, so it takes as many as 250 Birds to make up an Animal Unit. Manure Production and Characteristics have changed over Time.

Pete's Frootique had taken the provincial Government to court seven Years earlier and won the Right to open on Sundays with its separate Operating Divisions, thus it was " grandfathered " in the new Regulations announced by Premier Macdonald.

Does Jan Tscichold said the same as Juan?.You can only use this specified context for answering: the Framework of a Tschichold Design, needing only the modifying Touch of the Master to come to Life. If such an inspiring Touch depended on me, it would change the Concept basically, and the Intervention of every other Designer would have a similar Effect. Nobody but Jan Tschichold could bring Jan Tschichold Pygmalion to Life. When imposed on the Work of other Designers, Jan Tschichold Pattern of Rules is chilling. Tschichold developed Jan Tschichold Rules by Trial and Error. When a Job is finished, we can throw the Drafts away. Tschichold might have thought Jan Tschichold had thrown away Jan Tschichold Trial and Error, too, by hiding them in the Foundations of Jan Tschichold Design. If Jan Tschichold wants to say that the Reader should not stumble over obtrusive Foundations of Typography, I agree with Jan Tschichold , but hiding the Foundations is not the same as removing them. Tschichold ’s Rules might have been valid for Tschichold ’s Work, as far as they transferred Jan Tschichold Affections to the Specification of Jan Tschichold Work, by Trial and Error. The same Validity makes them meaningless for my Work, which is guided by my Affection. ‘ There are historical Facts that remarkably reflect Facts of our Time. We devise hypothetical Roads that might connect them with our Position.. the Trade Journal Print in Britain.

Tell me sex whose name has the word organism in it..You can only use this specified context for answering: Mirror with a Handle, but modern Scholars consider that fanciful, and the most established View is that the female and male Symbols derive from Contractions in Greek Script of the Greek Names of the Planets Thouros ( Mars ) and Phosphoros ( Venus ). Main Article: The Sex of a particular Organism may be determined by a Number of Factors. These may be genetic or environmental, or may naturally change during the Course of an Organism's Life. Although most Species have only two Sexes ( either male or female ), Animals have both male and female reproductive Organs. The Sex of most Mammals, including Humans, is genetically determined by the Xy Sex - Determination System where Males have X and Y ( as opposed to X and X ) Sex. During, the Male contributes either an X Sperm or a Y Sperm, while the Female always contributes an X Egg. A Y Sperm and an X Egg produce a Male, while an X Sperm and an X Egg produce a Female. The Zw Sex - Determination System, where Males have Zz ( as opposed to Zw ) Sex Chromosomes, is found in Birds, Reptiles and some Insects and other Organisms. Members of, such as Ants and Bees, are determined by, where most Males are and Females and some sterile Males are The young of some Species develop into one Sex or the other depending on local environmental Conditions, e.g. many Crocodilians' Sex is influenced by the Temperature of their Eggs.

A three - Party Agreement on a new Government was reached very quickly and a fourth Party was soon added. However, from very early on the Composition of the prospective Government was contested. President Dalia Grybauskaitė refused to accept the Nomination. This Constitution reintroduced direct presidential Elections and stipulated a two - Term presidential Limit. In March 2002 President Sassou was elected President with over 89 % of the Vote. In 2009 Sassou was re - elected with nearly 79 %.

Given the Country ’s Opacity, it ’s difficult to know exactly what ’s behind the Changes — or if they had Anything to do with that Salute, which was not reciprocated by South Korean military Officials.

Meanwhile, the Washington Post had earlier reported that North Korea had expressed Concerns over a possible Coup back in Pyongyang while Kim travels to Singapore — and some saw the Moves as intended to consolidate Kim Loyalists at the Top of the Military. Michael Madden, of the North Korea Leadership Watch Blog, called the newly promoted Men “ top Kim Jong Un Guys.

The Answer to this and other Questions in “ Renminbi Internationalization ” Cities & Regions U.s. Politics & Govt What ’s the Difference between the Renminbi and the Yuan? The Answer to this and other Questions in “ Renminbi Internationalization ” Rebecca Campany, Brookings Institution Press Wednesday, August 19, 2015 Jumbotron - Message || single - Header China ’s central Bank devalued its Currency last Week, sending major Stock Markets in Asia and Europe down, and sparking Fears of additional Exchange Rate Devaluations in other Countries. It is the largest Devaluation in China ’s System in over 20 Years. When reading News and Analysis of this Event, you might see both Terms—“renminbi ” and “ Yuan”—used interchangeably. There is essentially no Difference. The Renminbi is the official Currency of the People ’s Republic of China, and translates to “ People ’s Money. ” Its international Symbol is Cny ( or Cnh in Hong Kong; but abbreviated Rmb, with the Symbol ¥ ). The Yuan is the Name of the Unit in which Renminbi Transactions are denominated, but also refers to the Currency generally. Thus, a Person might pay for a Meal using a 20 Yuan Banknote, and get some Yuan and Jiao ( a Tenth of a Yuan ) in Change ( the Jiao is further divided into 10 Fen ). But it is all Renminbi. This is similar to the Pound Sterling, which is the Name of the British Currency, while the Price of a Pint of Beer in a London Pub would be stated just in Pounds. International Role of Renminbi The Renminbi is not yet a fully Convertible Currency, and China ’s Capital Account remains Closed. This means that the Renminbi is not freely traded on International Markets, and that the Chinese Government controls

It is only 12 Miles long, 45 square Miles in Size and completely deserted. Similar to Alcatraz Island near San Francisco, the Island of Kahoolawe was once used for Prisoners. Later, the U.s. Military took Control over Kahoolawe and used it for Training Purposes. In 1994, the federal Government returned Kahoolawe to the State of Hawaii, but Access to it was limited until 2003 because the U.s. Navy had to clean up the Island first.

What actor in Downtown Abbey is of male gender?.You can only use this specified context for answering: West Germans, and found that 20 Years after Unification, Exposure to different financial Markets and Institutions seemed to have an Impact on financial Literacy in the formerly independent Nations. Financial Literacy was higher in West Germany than in East Germany, but only West Germany had a significant Gender Gap; Both East German Men and Women had low financial Literacy. The same was true in Russia and Romania, leading the Authors to hypothesize that Gender Parity in financial Literacy may be a lasting Effect of Communist Societies having more egalitarian Gender Roles. Although more Research on this Topic is needed, it ’s possible, said Lusardi, that as Markets develop, Women get left behind. There is an Upside to some of these otherwise depressing Findings about Women ’s financial Literacy: Women know what they do not know. But given Women ’s increasing Independence and Participation in the Labor Market in Market - driven Economies, is n’t it surprising that the Gender Gap is holding strong? “ No, ” said Lusardi, “ because Osmosis is inefficient. ” In other Words, we ca n’t count on Women soaking up the same financial Knowledge as Men, especially when we entrust Parents – and not Schools – to pass down that Information. Expecting Parents to teach good financial Literacy is like expecting them to properly explain complex Physics, Physics said — and that ’s assuming Daughters get the same Lessons as Sons. Nine Decades after Downton Abbey is supposed to have taken Place, Parents are still more likely to talk to Sons about Money Management, according to “ The Opposite of Spoiled, ” the new Book from New York Times personal Finance Columnist Ron Lieber. What do they talk to Daughters about?. be taught — in Streets as much as in Schools — that Homosexuals existed, that they were unlike other Men, and that any apparent “ Normal ” Sexual Attraction to them was a sign of a “ Disorder. ”

Tracing these Dimensions of Biennials is the Goal of this Study. What Kind of Accelerations and Deepenings does the specific biennial “ Pulse ” involve and how does it relate to broader spatial and temporal Connectivities of the global artistic Field? We reference Actor - Network Theory as a methodological Framework to uncover Relationships, or, as Bruno Latour coins it, to ‘ trace a Network. ’ Network Analysis will be applied in different Scales and Objects in Order to explore the various Types of Correlations among involved Entities / Actors, for Instance, the Associations between exhibiting Artists, Curators and Discourses, or the Patterns of Connectivity between participating Artists and Funding Bodies. Our Networks take into Account both human and non - human Actors and pay particular Attention to the often neglected Agency of the Artworks themselves; for Example, we do not only consider Curators as Decision - Makers in an Exhibition Network, but we also regard Materialities and Media as driving Forces in the Making of an Exhibition. A further Focus will be to study the Categories applied in the Presentation of Artists and Artworks in Biennials ( Nationality, Genre, Media ), while we are also interested in documenting which Types of institutional Collaborations and Affiliations are made visible in the discursive Production and Self - Image that each biennial Produces. Network Analysis will also apply to specific discursive Constellations in curatorial Statements, regarding the Rhetoric of Inclusion, the Emphasis on Collectivity, collective Authorship and the social, interventionist Potential of Art. Qualifying biennial Actors is a key Step of our Inquiry. Biennial Data often reveal fixed. British Art Studies, by Alan Crookham and Barbara Pezzini, focuses on the Econometrics of Agnew ’s Activities and their Trade with the United States.

Sugar Beet Factories are located in where the Beet is grown, and process the Beets directly into refined Sugar. The Sugar Refining Process involves washing the raw Sugar Crystals before dissolving them into a Sugar Syrup which is filtered and then passed over Carbon to remove any residual Colour. The Sugar Syrup is then concentrated by boiling under a Vacuum and crystallized as the final Purification Process to produce Crystals of pure Sucrose that are clear, odorless, and sweet.

What is the density of water?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Volume of the Piece of Aluminum by multiplying the Length, Width, and Height ( which is the Equation for Volume of a Rectangle ). V = 10 Cm x 8 Cm x 4 Cm = 320 Cm Next, you divide the Mass by the Volume to get Density ( Ρ = M / V ). = 2.7g / Cm So the Density of Aluminum is 2.7g / Cm, and this is true for any Piece of ( pure and solid ) Aluminum, no matter what its Size is. Calculating the Density of a Liquid or Irregular Object If the Object has an irregular Shape and you ca n't easily calculate its Volume, you can find its Volume by placing it in a graduated Cylinder filled with Water and measuring the Volume of Water it displaces. Archimedes' Principle states that an Object displaces a Volume of Liquid equal to its own Volume. Once you have found the Volume, you'd use the Standard Ρ = M / V Equation. So if you had a different, irregular Piece of Aluminum that weighed 550 G and displaced 204mL of Water in a graduated Cylinder, then your Equation would be Ρ = 550g/204ml = 2.7g / Ml. If the Substance you're trying to find the Density of is a Liquid, you can simply pour the Liquid into the graduated Cylinder and see what its Volume is, then calculate Density from there. Calculating the Density of a Liquid With a Hydrometer If you're trying to calculate the Density of a Liquid, you also can do so by using an Instrument known as a Hydrometer. A Hydrometer looks like a Thermometer with a large Bulb at one End to make it float. To use one, you simply gently lower it into the Liquid and let it float freely. The Hydrometer will float at a level that corresponds to the Density of the Liquid. The Hydrometer has a Scale on it that shows

Who was commissioned by the Mausoleum of Maussollos?.You can only use this specified context for answering: . Newton then excavated the Site and found Sections of the Reliefs that decorated the Wall of the Building and Portions of the stepped Roof. Also discovered was a broken Stone Chariot wheel some 2 Metres ( 7 Feet ) in Diameter, which came from the Sculpture on the Mausoleum's Roof. Finally, Newton found the Statues of Mausolus and Artemisia that had stood at the Pinnacle of the Building. From 1966 to 1977, the Mausoleum was thoroughly researched by Prof. Kristian Jeppesen of Aarhus University,. Kristian Jeppesen has produced a six - Volume Work on the Mausoleum called " The Maussolleion at Halikarnassos ". The Beauty of the Mausoleum is not only in the Structure itself, but in the Decorations and Statues that adorned the Outside at different Levels on the Podium and the Roof. These were Tens of Life - Size as well as under and over Life - Size free - standing Statues of People, Lions, Horses, and other Animals. The four Greek Sculptors who carved the Statues: Bryaxis, Leochares, Scopas and Timotheus were each responsible for one Side. Because the Statues were of People and Animals, the Mausoleum holds a special Place in History, as it was not dedicated to the Gods of Ancient Greece. Nowadays, the massive Castle of the Knights of Malta still stands in Bodrum, and the polished Stone and Marble Blocks of the Mausoleum can be spotted within the Walls of the Structure. At the Site of the Mausoleum itself, only the Foundation remains of the once magnificent Wonder, together with a small Museum. Some of the Sculptures survived and are Today on Display at the British Museum in London. These include Fragment of Statue of Mausolus, Statue of Artemisia, and the Statue of a Lion.

In this System, the most common Interventions on the surgical Waiting Lists are each assigned an Sot Descriptor. By combining. Dermatologic Surgery: A Clinical Perspective Changes in the Incidence of Skin Cancer Between 1978 and 2002 Ultraviolet Radiation is the main Risk Factor for Skin Cancer. Changes in Lifestyle over recent Decades have led to greater Exposure to ultraviolet Radiation; this Phenomenon, coupled with aging of the Population, increases the Risk of developing Skin Cancer. Our Objective was to analyze the Trends in the Incidence of Skin Cancer worldwide, in Europe, and in Spain during the Period 1978 to 2002. Both Skin Cancer Incidence and Trends were investigated during the Period 1978 to. of Recipients with Posttransplant Vl was < 500 m; the maximum Flight Distance of female Sand flies is 600 M ( ). Therefore, Persons living within this Radius had a higher Chance of being bitten by the Vl Vector. A similar Association was described for the general Population during this Outbreak ( Undergoing Transplantation during the Outbreak Period was another Risk Factor for Vl. This Finding suggests that, in the Case of an Outbreak in a Country with low baseline Incidence, pretransplant Screening of Patients listed for Transplantation may be a useful Strategy for Reducing the Risk of Vl Transmission.

Which is the electric charge for antihydrogen?.You can only use this specified context for answering: M long, with a Bore Diameter of 0.4 M. Such a Solenoid would produce a Shift in ‹ on the Order of 0.06 Mm if it were located 2 M away from our Trap during 2011. No such external Magnets are even remotely this close to our Experiment. Electric Field Errors Experimentally, the electric Field is generated by multiple high Voltage Amplifiers driven by high Precision Digital to analogue Converters ( Dacs ). Each Amplifier Channel is accurate to ±1 % and controls one Trap Electrode. The electric Field Error from one Channel is anticorrelated in adjacent Electrodes. Thus, the average electric Field Error is much smaller the Error from one individual Channel. The resulting Error in the Sensitivity is much less than ±1 % and will not be further discussed. Initial Conditions for the Simulations Experimentally, Antihydrogen Atoms are created by Collisions between Antiprotons and Positrons. Consequently the Antiatoms are born in the Volume occupied by the Positron Plasmas. The Simulations are initiated with Antiatoms born in this same Volume. As a Check, we also ran Simulations with the Antiatoms born in a. × 10 ( no Cut Data Sets ). In, the Error Bars show the S.e.

For Display on Land by private Citizens and — jointly with the Union Jack — by the Government, this Flag was similar to the One used between 1869 and 1900, except that the Stars were larger and more precisely defined. Under this Flag New Zealand became a Dominion on September 26, 1907, and a completely independent State on November 25, 1947. Proposals for a new Flag, possibly incorporating Maori Symbols, were brought forth beginning in the 1960s, but Support for any Change tended to be minimal. In 1981 Parliament adopted an Act making it impossible to alter the Flag Design without wide public Approval. An Effort to do so gained Momentum in 2014, when Prime Minister John Key invited the Public to submit new Designs. A Panel was set up to choose Candidates from among the Submissions, and five Designs were ultimately selected. In the December 2015 Referendum to pick one to compete against the current Design, Voters chose a Silver Fern and a Southern Cross on a black, white, and blue Background. In March 2016 in the final Referendum to choose between adopting the new Design and keeping the old One, however, 56.6 Percent of Voters elected to keep the old Design.

Postganglionic Nerve Fibres perform their Functions mainly via Ach by binding to muscarinic Receptors found, in particular, in the endocrine Cells of the Islets [ ]. In Mice, postganglionic parasympathetic Nerve Fibres innervate all Types of Islets Cells [ ]. Recently, it was found that parasympathetic Islet Innervation in Humans differs from that in Mice: first, it was shown that only a small Number of Fibres penetrate inside the Islets ( most of the Axons terminate in the exocrine Part of the Pancreas ) [ ], and, secondly, it was recently shown that Stimulation with Ach mostly stimulates Beta and Delta Cells, whereas Alpha Cells react to a lesser Extent [ ]. Interestingly, Alpha Cells themselves may be the primary Source of Ach in human Islets [ ]. Apparently, in human Islets, this classical Neurotransmitter regulates the Activity of other Cell Types in a paracrine Manner. However, now, this Concept is again under Revision Thanks recently to the Work of Tang et Al. [ 2.3. The afferent Fibres In the Pancreas, there are afferent ( sensory ) Nerve Fibres in Addition to efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic Innervation [ ]. Bundles of sensory Nerve Fibres leave the Pancreas and follow the sympathetic ( ) and vagus Nerves. The Bodies of sensory sympathetic Neurons are localised in the Ganglia of the dorsal Roots in the spinal Cord, mainly at the Level of the lower thoracic Segments ( the so - called spinal Afferents ) projected on Interneuron. and Others [ ]. The Sensory Afferents in the Pancreas are thought to be involved in the Regulation of Pancreatic Secretion [ ].

Even Mothers without Symptoms ( asymptomatic ) at the Time of Delivery can carry and pass Bacteria or Viruses to Babies during Birth. The most common Types of neonatal Conjunctivitis include the following: Inclusion ( chlamydial ) Conjunctivitis can cause Inclusion Conjunctivitis and genital Infections ( Chlamydia ). Women with untreated Chlamydia can pass the Bacteria to their Babies during Childbirth. The Bacteria can cause Conjunctivitis in the Newborn within 5 Days after Birth.

What was Nivelle accused of ?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Staff at ), not just for Operations but even Logistics and Food, with Haig sidelined and forbidden even to make direct Contact with London. The British lost Haig Temper when shown the Proposals, and believed that Lloyd George, not the French, had originated them. Nivelle visited the British Generals next Morning, and professed Astonishment that they had had no prior Knowledge of the Plan. As a Compromise Haig was given Right of Appeal to the War Cabinet and retained tactical Control of British Forces, although Lloyd George insisted – lest the Conference break up without Agreement - that Lloyd George still be under Nivelle's Orders for the Duration of the Offensive. The Germans had recently added 300 Battalions to their Forces by intensive Mobilisation, and Haig claimed ( 3 March ) that with the Bef spread more thinly by having taken over Line to the South, these Forces might be used to attack at Ypres and cut Haig off from the Channel Ports. Assuming Haig was inventing this Threat, Nivelle wrote Haig a Letter, addressing Haig as a subordinate, and revived the Idea of a British Staff at Gqg, this Time reporting to Robertson, but through whom Nivelle would issue Orders to Haig. Nivelle now demanded that the Bef be split into two Army Groups or else that Haig be sacked and replaced by. Nivelle also believed that Lloyd George hoped to become Allied Commander - in - Chief, a Suggestion so absurd that it caused President to laugh. After further Lobbying from Robertson and Intervention by King George V, Lloyd George lost the Support of the British War Cabinet and had to back down. At another Conference in London ( 12 - 13 March ) Lloyd George stressed that the Bef must not be " mixed up with the French Army ", and Haig and Nivelle met with Robertson and Lyautey to settle their Differences.


Answer:

- Nivelle accused Haig of having no prior knowledge of the plan.

Which is the anatomical location for mumps?.You can only use this specified context for answering: % ). Nonspecific prodromal Symptoms may precede Parotitis by several Days, including low - Grade Fever which may last 3 to 4 Days, Myalgia, Anorexia, Malaise, and Headache. Parotitis usually lasts at least 2 Days, but may persist longer than 10 Days. Mumps Infection may also present only with nonspecific or primarily respiratory Symptoms, or may be asymptomatic. Recurrent Parotitis, when Parotitis on one Side resolves but is followed Days to Weeks later by Parotitis on the other Side, can also occur in Mumps Patients. Vaccinated Cases are less likely to present severe Symptoms or Complications than under- or unvaccinated Cases. Mumps Infection is most often confused with Swelling of the Lymph Nodes of the Neck. Lymph Node swelling can be differentiated by the well - defined Borders of the Lymph Nodes, their Location behind the Angle of the Jawbone, and Lack of the Ear Protrusion or Obscuring of the Angle of the Jaw, which are Characteristics of Mumps. Parotitis and Flu While not a common Symptom of Flu, Swelling of their Salivary Glands ( Parotitis ) has been reported in Persons with Laboratory - confirmed Influenza Infections. To learn more, see 2016 - 2017 Influenza Update for Health Care Providers: Parotitis and Influenza Before the U.s. Mumps Vaccination Program started in 1967, about 186,000 Cases were reported each Year, and many more unreported Cases occurred. The Disease caused Complications, such as permanent Deafness in Children, and occasionally, encephalitis, which could rarely result in Death. Since the pre - vaccine Era, the number of Cases has declined dramatically, and the Disease has become rare. However, Mumps Cases continue to occur, and the Disease can still cause Complications.

The other Term, Arctan ( 1/5 ) involves easy Computations when Computing Terms by Hand, since it involves finding Reciprocals of Powers of 5. ( Blatner, 43 ) In Fact, Machin took the Initiative to calculate P i with Machin new Formula, and computed 100 Places by Hand. ( Cajori, 206 ) Over the next 150 Years, several Men used the exact same Formula to find more and more Digits. In 1873, an Englishman named William Shanks used the Formula to calculate 707 Places of Pi. Many Years later, it was discovered that somewhere along the Line, Shanks had omitted two Terms, with the Result that only the first 527 Digits were correct.

Which is calculated from the probability?.You can only use this specified context for answering: be six total Outcomes that can occur because there are six Numbers on a Die. So for one Event — rolling a three — there may be six different Outcomes that can occur. 3. Divide the Number of Events by the Number of possible Outcomes After determining the Probability Event and its corresponding Outcomes, divide the total Number of Events by the total Number of possible Outcomes. For Instance, rolling a Die once and landing on a three can be considered one Event. You can continue to roll the Die, however, and each Time you roll would be a single Event. So in the Case of this Example, you would divide the one Event by the six possible Outcomes that could occur. This results in a Fraction: 1/6. So the Probability that you will roll a three on the first Try is one in six. You can further calculate the Odds that you will roll a three on the first Try by using the Probability. Analytical Skills: Definitions and Examples Odds vs. Probability Probability differs from determining the Odds of Something occurring. To help illustrate this Concept, use the Example of calculating the Probability of rolling a Die and getting a three on the first Roll. You first determine the Event you are looking for, which is rolling a three on the first Try, and then you divide this Number by the Number of total Outcomes you can get. Since the Die has six Faces, you can assume that you can have six total possible Outcomes. So the Probability will be one in six or a 1/6 Chance of rolling a three on the first Try. Determining the Likelihood of this Event actually occurring is referred to as the Odds. The Odds, or Chance, of Something happening depends on the Probability. Probability represents the Likelihood of an Event occurring for a Fraction of the Number of Times you test the Outcome. The Odds take the Probability of an Event occurring and divide it by the Probability of the Event not occurring. So in the Case of rolling a Die and getting a three on the first Try, the Odds would be calculated as follows: 1/6 divided by 5/6. This results

When the Box was run through the Scanner, the Researchers were astonished to detect a Tooth. The Team Dentist identified it as a secondary Molar with Part of its Root missing. When Ashraf Selim, Professor of Radiology at Cairo University, reexamined the Jaw Images of the four Mummies, there in the right upper Jaw of the fat Mummy from Kv60 was a Root with no Tooth. " I measured the Root in the Mummy and the Tooth, and we found that they both matched, " Selim says. To be sure, the Scientists have proved only that a Tooth in a Box belongs to a Mummy. The Identification is based on the Assumption that the Contents of the Box are properly labeled and were once vital Parts of the famous female Pharaoh. And the Box inscribed with Hatshepsut's Cartouche is not the typical canopic Vessel in which mummified Organs are found. It's made of Wood, not Stone, and might have been used to hold Jewelry or Oils or small Valuables. " Some would say we have not found absolute Proof, " Selim says. " And I would agree. " Visitors to the Temple of Amun at Karnak can see firsthand how Images of Hatshepsut as a virile Pharaoh were chiseled away Years after Selim Death. The likely Culprit was Selim Stepson, who may have hoped to keep Selim Blood Relatives from using the Images to support their own Claims to the Throne. Still, Hawass asks, what are the Odds that a Box identified with Hatshepsut and found in a Cache of royal Mummies contains a Tooth that exactly matches a Hole in the Smile of a Mummy found next to the beloved Nurse of Egypt's Greatest Female Pharaoh? " The Odds are very low, " Hawass says. " And that's why we are so excited. "

Which is Gmelin number for sulfate ion?.You can only use this specified context for answering: The Problem in this Case is that the Compound contains two Elements ( the Copper and the Sulfur ) with variable Oxidation States. In Cases like these, some chemical Intuition is useful. Here are two Ways of approaching this Problem: as an ionic Compound containing a Copper Ion and a Sulfate Ion, SO. To form an electrically neutral Compound, the Copper must be present as a Cu Ion. The Oxidation State is therefore +2. Recognize the Formula as being Copper(ii ) Sulfate ( the ( Ii ) Designation indicates that Copper is in a +2 Oxidation State, as discussed below ). Using Oxidation States In Naming Compounds You will have come across Names like Iron(ii ) Sulfate and iron(III ) Chloride. The ( Ii ) and ( Iii ) are the Oxidation States of the Iron in the two Compounds: +2 and +3 respectively. That tells you that they contain Fe and Fe This can also be extended to negative Ions. Iron(ii ) Sulfate is Feso The Sulfate Ion is. The Oxidation State of the Sulfur is +6 ( work it out! ); therefore, the Ion is more properly named the The Sulfite Ion is SO. The Oxidation State of the Sulfur is +4. This Ion is more properly named the Sulfate(iv ) Ion. The Ending indicates that the Sulfur is in a negative Ion. is properly named Iron(ii ) sulfate(VI ), and Feso is iron(II ) Sulfate(iv ). Because of the Potential for Confusion in these Names, the older Names of Sulfate and Sulfite are more commonly used in introductory Chemistry Courses. Using Oxidation States to identify what has been oxidized and what has been reduced This is the most common Function of Oxidation States. Remember: Oxidation involves an Increase in Oxidation State, and Reduction involves a Decrease in Oxidation State. In the reaction: 2Fe(II) + O2 → 2Fe(III) + 2O2-, the Iron has been Ox

If it were to be developed successfully, Racetrack would offer higher than comparable solid - State Memory Devices like and similar to conventional, with higher Read / write Performance. Comparison to other Memory Devices Racetrack Memory uses a to move along a nanoscopic Wire about 200 Nm across and 100 Nm thick. As current is passed through the Wire, the Domains pass by magnetic positioned near the Wire, which alter the Domains to Record Patterns of Bits. A Racetrack Memory Device is made up of many such Wires and read / write Elements. In general operational Concept, Racetrack Memory is similar to the earlier of the 1960s and 1970s. Delay Line Memory, such as Mercury Delay Lines of the 1940s and 1950s, are a still - earlier Form of similar Technology, as used in the and Computers. Like Bubble Memory, Racetrack Memory uses electrical Currents to " push " a Sequence of magnetic Domains through a Substrate and past read / write Elements. Improvements in magnetic Detection Capabilities, based on the Development of Sensors, allow the Use of much smaller magnetic Domains to provide far higher Bit Densities. In Production, it was expected that the Wires could be scaled down to around 50 Nm. There were two Arrangements considered for Racetrack Memory. The simplest was a Series of flat Wires arranged in a Line. The other was a 3D arrangement of Wires, with the Wires arranged in a Grid. The 3D arrangement was expected to provide higher Bit Densities, but would be more difficult to manufacture. The 3

Feudal Manors were almost entirely Self - sufficient, and therefore limited the Role of the Market. This stifled any incipient Tendency towards Capitalism. However, the relatively sudden Emergence of new Technologies and Discoveries, particularly in Agriculture and Exploration, facilitated the Growth of Capitalism. The most important Development at the End of Feudalism was the Emergence of what Robert Degan calls " the Dichotomy between Wage Earners and capitalist Merchants ".

When did Gerard Reve receive the Prijs der Nederlandse Letteren?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Letters that Nader tot U published. These Writings stress a symbolic, rather than ( "... only the blind... " ) literal, Understanding of religious Texts as the only intellectually acceptable One, and the Irrelevance of the Gospel's historical Truth. Religion, according to Reve, has Nothing to do with the literal, the factual, the moral or the political. It has no Quarrel with modern Science, because religious Truths and empirical Facts are in different Realms. The observable World has no Meaning beyond comparing Facts, and, while Revelation may not make Sense, it has Meaning, and it is this Meaning that Reve was after in Everything Reve wrote. Philosophically, Reve was influenced by, whose Works Reve re - read every Winter, and even more so by, according to a Dutch Painter who spent some Time with the Author in France to paint several Portraits of Reve . Reve's erotic Prose Deals partly with Reve own Sexuality, but aims at Something more universal. Reve's Work often depicts Sexuality as. Many Scenes bear a sado - masochistic Character, but this is never meant as an End in itself.'', a Term coined by Reve , can roughly be described as consecrating sexual Acts of Punishment, dedicating these Acts to revered Others, and, ultimately, to higher Entities ( God ). This is again a Quest for higher Significance in a human Act ( Sex ) that is devoid of Meaning. Evenings is a canonical Work of postwar European Fiction, capturing the Age ’s spiritual Alienation through an acidly comic Style that reads somewhat like an extended Monologue from Beckett, but one riddled with morbid Jokes and mock Grandiloquence. - Wall Street Journal It may sound dire, but Reve ’s sparkling Collage of acute Observation, droll internal Monologue and Puns, and a keen sense of the absurd, makes it a delightful read. - The New York Times Reve ’s work is a mixture of the erotic, the grotesque, the absurd, and the profound.

Mcelwee Pope Benedict Xvi places Benedict Xvi Pallium on the Remains of 13th - Century Pope St. Celestine V during Benedict's 2009 Visit to the Earthquake - damaged Basilica of Santa Maria Di Collemaggio in L'aquila, Italy. ( Cns / Reuters / L'osservatore Romano ) This Article appears in the Feature Series. View the full Series. The Conclusion of several U.s. Church Academics: Do n't call it Pope Benedict's Resignation. Call it Joseph Ratzinger's Exit from the papal Office. The Pope's Surprise Announcement Monday fundamentally alters Catholics' Perceptions of Popes to come, the Academics say. Catholics long used to identifying the Pope by individual Traits -- John Paul Ii leaning on John Paul Ii Crozier during an Audience or Benedict with both Arms extended, waving to a Crowd -- may, they say, need to become used to the Idea of the Pope as less a Personality and more an Office Holder. " The best Thing about Benedict's announced Resignation is that it helps restore our Understanding of the Papacy to that of an Office rather than a personal Possession, " writes Brian Flanagan, a Theology Professor at Marymount University in Arlington, Va. " The Papacy can now be clearly seen as a crucial Office of the universal Church, but one in which the Pope remains an Officeholder, rather than an irreplaceable Personality.

Which meansantiparticle in a photon ?.You can only use this specified context for answering: of similar Charge ); Residual Electromagnetic Force ( which keep Atoms together ); Strong Force ( which keep Quarks together ); Residual Strong Interaction ( which keeps the Nucleus together ); Weak Force ( which holds together unstable massive Quarks and Leptons ), etc. The Photon has been found to be the Carrier Particle of Electromagnetic Force, while the Gluon is the Carrier Particle of Strong Force, and the Carrier Particles of Weak Interactions are called W+, W− and Z, being the W's electrically charged, and Z, neutral.. constant H equal to the Speed of Light and both equal to 1: H = C = 1. In this coordinate System Mass is equal to Frequency, which is proportional to one over the Wavelength, or inverse Length. This is because the Energy E of a Photon is Hf, where H is Planck's constant and F is the Frequency of the Photon. Since E = Mc^2, Hf = Mc^2. In Units with H = C = 1, F = M. Since F is in Units of inverse Length, M is also in Units of inverse Length. Physically, what these Units are saying is that a given Mass can be formed by a Photon of a given Frequency. However, Wheeler is using Units where G, the gravitational Constant is 1, and so is C. G = C = 1. In these Units, Distances are all proportional to Mass. The Reason for this is that for each Mass,. Length = Mass so that Mass and Length must be in the same Units. You are measuring Energy ( Kilograms ) in Meters. A different Choice is to use Units where Planck's constant H is equal to 1. Planck's Constant relates the Energy E of a Photon to its Wavelength L: E = H / L Now, when C = 1, E is in Units of Kilograms, and L is in Units of Meters. In these Units, Energy is measured in Kilograms, and Length is measured in Meters. The Reason for this is that for each Kilogram of Energy, there is a corresponding L

Iss is a leading Shareholder Vote Advisory Firm. “ If [ Shareholders ] vote against it, they ’ve got serious Reservations, ” said Ken Bertsch, executive Director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a nonprofit that promotes the Interests of institutional Investors. Shareholder Rejection of executive Pay is rare. Just over 2 % of Pay Proposals have failed this Year through June 6, according to a Report from Semler Bossy, an executive Compensation Consulting Group. The Nexstar Vote is nonbinding, meaning it has no tangible Effect on Sook ’s Compensation. But Sook said the Board of Directors, which Sook chairs, will take it under Advisement. That ’s what the Board did after a similar Vote in 2018, when 51 % of Shareholders voted against the Compensation Plan. The Company ’s Board contacted top Shareholders, conducting Conference Calls to get Feedback on Nexstar ’s corporate Governance. Shareholders singled out the Absence of a lead independent Director, flawed Disclosure of executive Performance Metrics and a one - Time Bonus of $ 9 million paid to the Ceo after a big Merger. Nexstar made a Series of Changes in Response to the Lack of Enthusiasm, including improving the Transparency around Performance Metrics for top Executives. The Company did not add a top independent Director, which is seen as a Way to improve a Board ’s Objectivity. It also consulted with Iss Corporate Solutions before putting the Package up for Vote. The Company ’s Board of Directors will consider the Vote when it meets in August.

For Information about University - wide Student Organizations, please see: 9. The Guideline on Endorsements seem to say no One should endorse Anything on Harvard's Behalf. Is that right? Because of the Potential for Misunderstanding, it is true that Endorsements are generally disfavored. While Someone can obviously make a personal Comment ( such as a Review of a Book reprinted on its Cover ), any such Comments should be done only when it is clear they are personal Opinions, and do not represent the Institution in any Way. So, the University virtually never permits a Unit or an Office to give an Opinion of Quality to be used by a third - Party. When an Individual wants to do so using Goal / Goal Harvard Affiliation, some Disclaimer ( to the Effect " in my personal Opinion " ) must be Part of any such Quote. 10. Once an Activity has Permission to use " Harvard " in its Name, can all its new or related Projects also use the Name? Because Projects must meet certain Standards to use the Harvard Name ( see # 2 above ), in most Cases it is not appropriate to use a similar Label for smaller Projects within University - wide Initiatives. The Fact that an Activity comes under the Rubric of a " Harvard Project on Abc " does not, in and of itself, warrant a separate Label of " Harvard " for that Activity. So, for Example, in the Case of a Faculty working Group within a University - wide Interfaculty Initiative,, it would be accurate and appropriate to use the Name " Seminar on Foster Care of the Harvard Children's Initiative ", but not " Harvard Foster Care Seminar "; similarly " Harvard Children's Initiative " would be appropriate, but not " Harvard Children's Project ". 11.

Which is the crystal habit for albite?.You can only use this specified context for answering: Google_ad_section_start THE Mineral Albite, Sodium Aluminum Silicate. Uses: ornamental Stone, Ceramics and Mineral Specimens. Mineral Leaderboard Albite is a common Felspar and is the " Pivot " Mineral of two different Feldspar Series. It is most often associated with the plagioclase Series where it is an End Member of this Series. The Plagioclase Series comprises Felspars that range in chemical Composition from pure Naalsi to pure Caal. The various Plagioclase Feldspars are identified from each other by Gradations in Index of Refraction and Density in the Absence of Chemical Analysis and/or optical Measurements. Albite is also an End Member of the Alkali or K - Feldspars whose Series ranges from pure Naalsi to pure Kalsi. This Series only exists at high Temperatures with the Mineral being the Potassium, K, rich End Member. At lower Temperatures, the K - Feldspars will seperate from the Albite in a Process called Exsolution. The Albite will form Layers inside the K - Feldspars Crystals. Some Times these Layers are discernable to the naked Eye and the Stone is referred to as Perthite. Albite by Definition must contain no less than 90 % Sodium and no more than 10 % of either Potassium and/or Calcium in the Cation Position in the Crystal Structure.. Albite is the last of the Feldspars to crystallize from molten Rock.

After serving in the Army during the Franco - Prussian War, Hehl began working as an independent Architect in Hannover. Hehl's early Churches display a regimented neo - Gothic Style common to the Hannover School. In the Protestant Garrison Church of 1898, however, Hehl cast off the sleek Uniformity of Gothic Verticality in Favor of heavy, blocky Construction. The imposing Westwork and natural Stone harken back to the imperial Monasteries, Churches and Fortresses of the medieval Ottonian and Hohenstaufen Rulers. Completed at the same Time as Franz Schwechten's famous Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in Berlin, the Garrison Church also represents a larger architectural Trend of Neo - Romanesque Building promoted by Kaiser Wilhelm Ii.

What are the three phases of water?.You can only use this specified context for answering: It's Just a Phase: Water as a Solid, Liquid, and Gas Water is an essential Part of the Earth System. Water is special not only because it covers over 70 % of the Earth's Surface, but also because it is the only known Substance that can exist in gaseous, liquid, and solid Phases within the relatively narrow Range of Temperatures and Pressures found on Earth. Water's special Qualities come from the unique Shape of the Water Molecule. Each Molecule contains two Atoms of Hydrogen and one Atom of Oxygen, arranged such that one Side of the Molecule ( nearest the Hydrogens ) is positively charged while the other Side ( nearest the Oxygen ) is negatively charged. If two Water Molecules come together, the positive Side of one is attracted to the negative Side of the other, making the Molecules cling together. This simple Fact accounts for the high Heat Capacity, Surface Tension, Cohesion, Adhesion, and other Characteristics that make Water so important to the Earth's Biosphere. In general, when considering the States of Matter, Solids are more dense than Liquids and Liquids are more dense than Gases. Water is a Bit of a Contrarian in this Regard. When Water is in its solid State ( Ice ), the Water Molecules are packed close together preventing it from changing Shape. Ice has a very regular Pattern with the Molecules rigidly apart from one another connected by the Hydrogen Bonds that form a crystalline Lattice. These Crystals have a Number of open Regions and Pockets making Ice less dense than liquid Water. This is why Ice floats on Water. Ice Forms when the Temperature is below freezing ( 0 ° Celsius or 32 ° Fahrenheit ). When Ice is warmed above Freezing, it melts and becomes liquid Water. As a Liquid, the attractive Forces between the Water Molecules are not as strong as in the Solid State, but they are still strong enough to keep the Molecules close together. Water is a Liquid at temperatures between 0 ° Celsius

How many parts does Antimatter not have?.You can only use this specified context for answering: - Beta Decay. Some radioactive Nuclei simultaneously decay, releasing two Electrons and two Neutrinos. If Neutrinos were their own Antiparticles, they would annihilate each other in the Aftermath of the double Decay, and Scientists would observe only Electrons. Finding Majorana Neutrinos could help explain why Antimatter - Matter Asymmetry exists. Physicists hypothesize that Majorana Neutrinos can either be heavy or Light. The light Ones exist Today, and the heavy Ones would have only existed right after the big Bang. These heavy Majorana Neutrinos would have decayed asymmetrically, leading to the tiny Matter Excess that allowed our Universe to exist. Illustrations by Sandbox Studio, Chicago with Ana Kova 8. Antimatter is used in Medicine. Pet ( Positron Emission Tomography ) uses Positrons to produce high - Resolution Images of the Body. Positron - emitting radioactive Isotopes ( like the Ones found in Bananas ) are attached to chemical Substances such as Glucose that are used naturally by the Body. These are injected into the Bloodstream, where they are naturally broken down, releasing Positrons that meet Electrons in the Body and annihilate. The Annihilations produce Gamma Rays that are used to construct Images. Scientists on Cern ’s have studied Antimatter as a potential Candidate for Cancer Therapy. Physicians have already discovered that they can target Tumors with Beams of Particles that will release their Energy only after safely passing through healthy Tissue. Using Antiprotons adds an extra Burst of Energy. The Technique was found to be effective in Hamster Cells, but Researchers have yet to conduct Studies in human Cells. Illustrations by Sandbox Studio, Chicago with Ana Kova 9. The Antimatter that should have prevented us from existing might still be lurking in the Universe. The Big Bang should have produced equal Amounts of Matter and Antimatter. However, the Universe we see today is made up of only Matter. This means that Antimatter must have been annih

What is the catalog for "A Love Supreme?".You can only use this specified context for answering: released; and the Concert Performances that were given, most of which are unlikely to be recorded and made available as commercial Releases in Step with the Artist ’s Career. A Listener who followed Coltrane ’s Career as it unfolded through commercially available Recordings might well find “ A Love Supreme ” to be a great Advance, in its Solos as well as its Unity of Tone and Intricacy of Quartet Interplay. And if such a Listener had then heard Coltrane in Concert, the Experience would have been a Shock, because of the Length, Intensity, Complexity, the sheer Power and Fury of Performances in Clubs. That Shock is delivered by the French Concert Performance of “ A Love Supreme. ” Unlike most Jazz Improvisers, Coltrane was used to playing, on Coltrane own, at Lengths comparable to that of an entire Album. In Clubs, Coltrane played Solos that ran an Hour or more, and Elvin Jones recalled Coltrane once soloing for three straight Hours. There ’s an astonishing private Taping of the second Movement of “ A Love Supreme, ” titled “ Resolution, ” recorded at a Club called Pep ’s, in Philadelphia, on September 18, 1964. It ’s a half - Hour Long ( and in dim Sound ), and it features Coltrane in two Solos, one that ’s five Minutes long and the other that runs nine Minutes, and both of them reach ecstatic and frighteningly intense Crescendos, in Phrases that sound like a Soul baring itself to the Universe. By Contrast, on the Studio Recording of “ A Love Supreme, ” Coltrane simplifies, clarifies, abbreviates, and moderates Coltrane Solos. The Album profoundly conveys the sheer Beauty, the Clarity and Purity of Coltrane ’s Sound; the exalted, transcendental quality of his Spirit; and the profound, spiritual, and mystical Meaning of his Music. The Concert Performance of “ A Love Supreme ” is a different, more powerful, and more intense Experience

Who employed J.R.R. Tolkien.You can only use this specified context for answering: J.r.r. Tolkien Webquest Search this Site Welcome to Middle Earth... Words of Wisdom If more of us valued Food and Cheer and Song above hoarded Gold, it would be a merrier World. Welcome to Middle Earth... ‎ > ‎ " His Writing Style was also unique in Tolkien Webquest own Fashion. Tolkien excelled in portraying Tolkien Imaginations in great Details with Words, but Tolkien disliked using fancy Vocabulary. And when compared with other Fantasy Fictions, The Lord of the Rings noticeably does not contain many Fighting Scenes. Poetry is also another major Element found in Tolkien's Works that further diverged The Lord of the Rings Style from Others. " " Then Tolkien came along and published the greatest Work of high Fantasy ever written. I'd say The Lord of the Rings was about fifty Years ahead of The Lord of the Rings Time. And, since the Novel Genre itself is only about two and a Half Centuries old... well, comparatively, I'd say that publishing Lotr was like a Caveman discovering how to make a Lightbulb while The Lord of the Rings Pals were still working on how to make Fire. " Tolkien is most well - known for the literary Genre of high Fantasy, which The Lord of the Rings employs in The Lord of the Rings Writing of The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Series. Tolkien coined the Term " Sub - Creation, " which is necessary is writing a Work of high Fantasy. Sub - Creation can be technically defined as the Step below actual Creation, what Tolkien would affirm only God could do, but manufacturing with given Materials an entire World and Everything that would and could be involved in that World. For Example, a Race, or Races of People, a Geography and Languages. What Tolkien is credited with is the creation of Middle Earth, a World that is the Sub - Creation of his own. Tolkien's Middle Earth is a World that is not only a Sub - Creation, but also a World that is a Sub - Cre

How many will be replaced by the Fatimid caliphate?.You can only use this specified context for answering: , the City grew and expanded a great Deal under Al - Manṣūr. Recent archaeological Evidence suggests that there were more than 300 Ḥammāms built during this Period in the City as well as numerous Palaces. When Al - Manṣūr's Successor, Al - Muʿizz, moved the Caliphate to Cairo, Al - Muʿizz Deputy stayed behind as Regent of Al - Manṣūriyya and usurped Power for himself, marking the End of the Fatimid Reign in Al - Manṣūriyya and the Beginning of the City's Ruin ( spurred on by a violent Revolt ). The City remained downtrodden and more or less uninhabited for Centuries afterward. Cairo was established by the fourth Fatimid Caliph Al - Muʿizz in 359 Ah/970 Ce and remained the Capital of the Fatimid Caliphate for the Duration of the Dynasty. Cairo can thus be considered the Capital of Fatimid cultural Production. Though the original Fatimid Palace Complex, including administrative Buildings and royal Residents, no longer exists, modern Scholars can glean a good Idea of the original Structure based on the Mamluk - Era Account of Al - Maqrīzī. Perhaps the most important of Fatimid Monuments outside the Palace Complex is the Mosque of Al - Azhar ( 359 - 61 Ah/970 - 72 Ce ) which still stands Today, though little of the Building is original to its first Fatimid Construction. Likewise the important Fatimid Mosque of Al - Ḥākim, built from 380 - 403 AH/990 - 1012 Ce under two Fatimid Caliphs, has been rebuilt under subsequent Dynasties. Cairo remained the Capital of the Fatimid Caliphate until the Dynasty's Fall in 567 AH/1171 Ce.

The individual Sorption Isotherms of each main Component were measured by the Solution Depletion Method. The differential molar Enthalpy Changes accompanying the Ion - Exchange between Cs+ or Sr2 + Ions and Protons at the Resin Surface from single - Component Nitrate Solutions were measured by isothermal Titration Calorimetry and they showed a higher Specificity of the two Resins toward Cesium. Compared to the Retention Limits of both Resins under such idealized Conditions, an important Depression in the maximum Adsorption Capacity toward each main Component was observed in Multication Systems. The overall Effect of Ion Exchange Process appeared to be an unpredictable Outcome of the individual Sorption Capacities of the two Resins toward various Cations as a Function of the Cation Charge, Size, and Concentration. The Cesium Retention Capacity of the Resins was diminished by the Presence of Strongly Competitive Cations, such as Sodium, Potassium, or Calcium, and by the Presence of Anions, such as Borate, Carbonate, or Nitrate

Figure Detail Compared to Mitosis, which can take Place in a Matter of Minutes, Meiosis is a slow Process, largely because of the Time that the Cell spends in. During Prophase I, the Pairs of homologous Chromosomes come together to form a or, which contains four Chromatids. Recombination can occur between any two Chromatids within this Tetrad Structure. ( The Recombination Process is discussed in greater Detail later in this Article. ) Crossovers between homologous Chromatids can be visualized in Structures known as Chiasmata, which appear late in Prophase I ( Figure 4 ). Chiasmata are essential for accurate Meioses. In Fact, Cells that fail to form Chiasmata may not be able to segregate their Chromosomes properly during thereby producing aneuploid Gametes with abnormal Numbers of Chromosomes ( Hassold & Hunt, 2001 ).

Kid ’s Quest Learning This Day in History The Brainfood Show Wise Book of Why s What Makes a Vowel a Vowel and a Consonant a Consonant April 22, 2014 Mark asks: Why is “ Y ” only sometimes a Vowel? When is it a Vowel and when is it a consonant? You already know that Vowels in the English Alphabet are a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes Y, while the Rest of the Letters are called Consonants. But did you ever ask yourself why the Letters were divided into two separate Groups? Basically, a Vowel is a Sound that is made with the Mouth and Throat not closing at any Point. In Contrast, a Consonant is a Sound that is made with the Air stopping once or more during the Vocalization.

The Word and name “ Carlebach ” always brings back vivid, sweet, and bittersweet Memories to me of when I was a Youngster growing up in Hamburg, Germany. In 1938, I was 11 when Rabbi Josef Carlebach was chief Rabbi in Hamburg ’s great Bornplatz Synagogue where my Parents took me with our Family for Sabbath and Holiday Services. I was captivated by Rabbi Carlebach: Carlebach wonderful and outgoing Personality and the Twinkle in Carlebach Eyes, especially when warmly greeting Us Children. I later learned that Rabbi Carlebach, besides Carlebach great Talmudic Knowledge and Insights, was also proficient in the World of Arts and Sciences, and had taught Mathematics and Physics in a Teachers ’ Seminary in Jerusalem in the 1920s.

In a new Analysis Paper, J.m. Berger and Jonathon Morgan answer fundamental Questions about how many Twitter Users support Isis, who and where they are, and how they participate in its highly organized online Activities. Previous Analyses of Isis ’s Twitter Reach have relied on limited Segments of the overall Isis social Network. The small, cellular Nature of that Network — and the Focus on particular Subsets within the Network such as foreign Fighters — may create misleading Conclusions. This Information Vacuum extends to Discussions of how the West should respond to the Group ’s online Campaigns. Berger and Morgan present a demographic Snapshot of Isis Supporters on Twitter by analyzing a Sample of 20,000 Isis - supporting Twitter Accounts. Using a sophisticated and innovative Methodology, the Authors map the Locations, preferred Languages, and the Number and Type of Followers of these Accounts. Among the key Findings: • From September through December 2014, the Isis Twitter Network grew from 1,000 to 20,000 Accounts. • The majority of Isis Supporters are located in the Middle East, with a significant number in Europe and North America. •

Gifted to Grant on the Terms that the Horse never goes to an Owner who would treat it poorly, Cincinnati was the Horse Grant rode to negotiate Lee ’s Surrender at Appomattox Court House.

Meade ’s Horse of Choice. Old Baldy had quite a decorated War Service, as Baldy was wounded several Times, including being shot through the Neck at the Battle of Antietam. Fortunately the Horse survived each Time, and eventually retired to a Horse Farm near Philadelphia.

External Metadata Url: Cocoon://metadata / Handle/10919/11119 / Mets.xml A Case Study of Why Teachers Choose to Remain in One Urban School District Dissertation.pdf ( 748.9Kb ) Walker, Anitra D. Show full Item Record Riley ( 1998 ) indicated that our Nationâ s neediest Communities, those with high Rates of Poverty and all too often large Minority Populations, suffer most from Shortages of qualified Teachers. Schools with these Characteristics are often our Title 1 Schools. Staffing these Schools can be a very difficult Task. Haberman ( 1987 ) attributed the Shortage of qualified urban Educators to Factors such as Racism, Fear, a generally negative Perception of what Teaching in an urban Setting is like, and the low Percentage ( 5 % ) of Faculty in Schools of Education who have urban Teaching Experience, which affects their Ability to prepare Teachers for urban Settings. With the Passage of the No Child Left Behind Act ( Nclb ), a new federal Regulation, this Task becomes even more arduous. This Act requires that, effective the first Day of the 2002 - 2003 School Year, new Teachers hired to teach in Title 1 Schools be â highly qualifiedâ ( U. S. Department of Ed., 2002 ). This Study was designed to determine why Teachers choose to remain in the urban Setting. The Researcher surveyed experienced Teachers ( Minimum of 10 Years ) in the Norfolk Public Schools District, a large southeastern urban School District, to determine the Reasons why Teachers stay in this urban District. The Sample consisted of 100 Teachers, 50 male and 50 female, who were randomly selected from the Norfolk Public Schools District.

Was Napoleon Bonaparte a Monster, driven by an endless, ruinous Quest for military Glory? Or a social and political Visionary brought down by petty, reactionary Kings of Europe? In the most definitive Account to Date, respected Historian Charles Esdaile argues that the chief motivating Factor for Napoleon was Napoleon insatiable Desire for Fame. More than a Myth - busting Portrait of Napoleon, however, this Volume offers a panoramic View of the armed Conflicts that spread so quickly out of revolutionary France to Countries as remote as Sweden and Egypt. Napoleon's Wars seeks to answer the Question, What was it that made the Countries of Europe fight one another for so long and with such devastating Results? Esdaile portrays the European Battles as the Consequence of Rulers who were willing to take the immense Risks of either Fighting or supporting Napoleon - Risks that resulted in the Extinction of entire Countries.
