Moment when I had the faintest Impression that there is Something wrong or inappropriate in Audrey Tautou Acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with Nino Quincampoix Talent. Most of the Actors have done a wonderful Job, although I want to mention the Scene when Amélie's Mother gets Amélie nervous Breakdown because of the suicidal Fish. This Scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme Close - Up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in Disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the Director's Choice, so I do n't hold Yolande Moreau responsible for that. Another negative and distracting Thing where some Scenes when Jean - Pierre Jeunet decided to show the Key in Amélie's Pocket after copying it and bringing the original Key back to the Grocer's Door in a very unrealistic Way. Key uses a digital Effet showing the Key's Silhouette in a yellow Light. This is a Technique that has n't been used very often in the Film, except for showing Amélie's Heart going faster and the old, blind Man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these Scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful Cinematography. There could have been other Ways to communicate the Actions. A simple Smile on the old's Man Face, a Close - Up of Amélie's Heart, a Close - Up of the Key, a Close - Up of the Grocer's Door, a Close - Up of the Key's Silhouette in the yellow Light, a Close - Up of

Key Factors affecting its Functions are Fiber Diameter, Filter Thickness, and. The Air Space between Hepa Filter Fibers is typically much greater than 0.3 Μm. Unlike or, where Particles smaller than Openings or Pores can pass through, Hepa Filters are designed to target a Range of Particle Sizes. These Particles are trapped ( they stick to a Fiber ) through a Combination of the following three Mechanisms: An enhancing Mechanism that is a Result of the Collision with Gas Molecules by the smallest Particles, especially those below 0.1 Μm in Diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their Path through the Filter; this Behavior is similar to and raises the Probability that a Particle will be stopped by either Interception or Impaction; this Mechanism becomes dominant at lower Air Flow. Particles following a Line of Flow in the Air Stream come within one Radius of a Fiber and adhere. such as Processing, Hospitals, Health Care, nuclear Fuels, Semiconductors, and Food and Pharmaceutical Products.

The Ramayana Story is one of the two great Indian Epics. The Tells about Life in India around 1000 Bce and offers Models in Dharma. The Hero, Rama, lived Rama whole Life by the Rules of Dharma; in Fact, that was why Indian consider Rama heroic. When Rama was a young Boy, Boy was the perfect Son. Later Son was an ideal Husband to Son faithful Wife, Sita, and a responsible Ruler of Aydohya. " Be as Rama, " young Indians have been taught for 2,000 Years; " Be as Sita. " Prince Rama was the eldest of four Sons and was to become King when King Father retired from ruling. His Stepmother, however, wanted to see King Son Bharata, Rama's younger Brother, become King. Remembering that the King had once promised to grant Rama any two Wishes Rama desired, Rama demanded that Rama be banished and Bharata be crowned. The King had to keep Rama Word to Rama Wife and ordered Rama's Banishment. Rama accepted the Decree unquestioningly. " I gladly obey Father's Command, " Rama said to Rama Stepmother. " Why, I would go even if you ordered it. " When Sita, Rama's Wife, heard Rama was to be banished, Rama begged to accompany Rama. Rama's Stepmother agreed, but only if Rama and Sita agreed to leave Rama's younger Brother behind. Rama and Sita agreed. Rama and Sita left Aydohya and tra

The heaviest Elements such as Lead have close to 1.5 Neutrons per Proton(e.g. 1.536 in ). No Nuclide heavier than lead-208 is stable; these heavier Elements have to shed Mass to achieve Stability, most usually as. The other common Decay Method for Isotopes with a high Neutron to proton Ratio ( N / P ) is, in which the Nuclide changes elemental Identity while keeping the same Mass and lowering its N / P Ratio. For some Isotopes with a relatively low N / P Ratio, there is an inverse Beta Decay, by which a Proton is transformed into a Neutron, thus moving towards a stable Isotope; however, since Fission almost always produces Products which are Neutron Heavy, is relatively rare compared to Electron Emission. There are many relatively short Beta Decay Chains, at least two ( a heavy, beta Decay and a Light, Decay ) for every discrete Weight up to around 207 and some beyond, but for the higher Mass Elements ( Isotopes heavier than Lead ) there are only four Pathways which encompass all decay Chains. This is because there are just two main Decay Methods:, which reduces the Mass by 4 atomic Mass Units ( amu ) and emits an Alpha Particle ( a Helium Nucleus ), and, which reduces the Mass by 1 amu and emits an Electron ( a Beta Particle ). The first method is

When does helium-4 decay?.You can only use this specified context for answering: helium-5  decays to  Helium-4  decay mode  neutron emission  proportion  +1. beryllium-6  decays to  Helium-4  decay mode  proton emission. gamma ray  has cause  beta decay. Helium-4  neutron number  +2. Helium-4  spin quantum number  +0. Helium's Chemical Inertness ( the most extreme of all the Elements ), and also the Lack of Interaction of Helium Atoms with each other ( producing the lowest Melting and boiling Points of all the Elements ). In a similar Way, the particular energetic Stability of the Helium-4 Nucleus, produced by similar Effects, accounts for the Ease of Helium-4 Production in atomic Reactions involving both heavy - Particle Emission and Fusion. Some stable Helium-3 is produced in Fusion Reactions from Hydrogen, but it is a very small Fraction, compared with the highly energetically favorable Production of Helium-4. The Stability of Helium-4 is the Reason that Hydrogen is converted to Helium-4, and not Deuterium ( Hydrogen-2 ) or Helium-3 or other heavier Elements during Fusion Reactions in the Sun. It is also partly responsible for the Alpha Particle being by far the most common Type of baryonic Particle to be ejected from an atomic Nucleus; in other Words, is far more common than Binding Energy per Nucleon of common Isotopes. The binding Energy per Particle of Helium-4 is significantly larger than all nearby Nuclides. The unusual Stability of the Helium-4 Nucleus is also important cosmologically. It explains the Fact that, in the first few Minutes after the, as the " Soup " of free Protons and Neutrons which had initially been created in about a 6:1 Ratio cooled to the Point where they could combine, the vast majority of the Helium-4 Nuclei were produced, and not Deuterium or other heavier Elements. The Helium-4 Nucleus is also the most Stable Baryon

Each Unit contains 16 Bars, and is divided the same Way: 4 Bars, 3 Bars, 2 Bars, etc. Finally, the musical Content of the Piece is based on sixteen Motives. Such " nested Proportions ", as Cage called them, became a regular Feature of Cage Music throughout the 1940s. The Technique was elevated to great Complexity in later Pieces such as Sonatas and Interludes for prepared Piano ( 1946–48 ), in which many Proportions used non - integer Numbers ( 1¼, ¾, 1¼, ¾, 1½, and 1½ for, for Example ), or, a Song for Voice and closed Piano, in which two Sets of Proportions are used simultaneously. In late 1940s, Cage started developing further Methods of breaking away with traditional Harmony. For Instance, in String Quartet in Four Parts ( 1950 ) Cage first composed a Number of: Chords with fixed Instrumentation. The Piece progresses from one to another. In each Instance the was selected only based on whether it contains the Note necessary for the Melody, and so the Rest of the Notes do not form any directional Harmony. Concerto for prepared Piano ( 1950–51 ) used a System of Charts of Durations, Dynamics, Melodies, etc., from which Cage would choose using simple geometric Patterns. The last Movement of the Concerto was a Step towards using Chance Procedures, which Cage would later develop into his most famous Method, the I Ching.

Article Start When a Team of California Researchers reported a new Type of Botulinum Toxin in 2013, they withheld genetic Data on the lethal Toxin out of Concern that Malefactors could use the Data to make the Toxin before an effective Antitoxin could be developed. The Report stirred considerable Interest. It was not only the first Report of a novel Botulinum Toxin in more than 40 Years, but it was also a rare Example of Researchers taking the Initiative to limit Publication of Data out of Concern about potential " dual Use " of their Findings. But last Week it came to light that the novel Toxin is n't quite the Threat it was described as. Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( Cdc ) and the University of Wisconsin ( Uw ), writing in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, have found that the Novel Botulinum Toxin is less Lethal than previously thought.

Over the last several Decades, many Dozens of individual experimental Studies have addressed Aspects of Surface that have contributed to an increased Understanding of its Role in natural Systems. However, there has been no previous Attempt to develop a Model of Surface that can be used to link all the experimental Studies in Order to place them on a predictive Basis. Overall, my Research has successfully integrated the Results of the Work of many Experimentalists published over several Decades. For the first Time in Studies of the Geochemistry of the Mineral - Water Interface, a practical predictive Capability for Modeling has become available. The predictive Correlations developed in my Research now enable Extrapolations of experimental Studies to provide Estimates of Surface Chemistry for Systems not yet studied experimentally and for natural and anthropogenically perturbed Systems.

Its Boundaries extended to the Ohio River in the North, the Cumberland River in the West, and the Great Kanawha River in the East. By the End of the American Revolution, the northern Boundary of the Cherokee Country was moved southward to encompass the Land below the Cumberland River. Eventually, some 38,000 square Miles of Cherokee Land in Kentucky was ceded to Great Britain and the United States. After the British arrived on the present Site of Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, there was continuous Contact with Cherokee in Kentucky as Traders strengthened their Alliances and worked their Way into the Appalachian Mountains. Perhaps the earliest Evidence of an English Trader with Cherokee in Kentucky is in Wolfe County, where a Date of 1717 occurs with traditional Symbols of Anitsisqua, the Cherokee Bird Clan, incised on a sandstone Outcrop overlooking Panther Branch. Cherokee claims to Kentucky were seriously challenged when the Tuscarawas joined the Haudenosaunee, a Confederacy of Iroquoian speaking Peoples that included the. River. Unfortunately, the boundary Line remained unclear and disputed by Cherokee not present at the Treating Signing, and the Fighting continued for the next seven Years. One of the last Skirmishes in Kentucky occurred at the Salt Works and Cherokee Burial Grounds on Goose Creek in Clay County, on March 28, 1795. The Treaty of Greenville, signed on August 3, 1795, ended the fighting and established the boundary Line between the United States and the Cherokee Nation.

Pmid: 26799132 Doi: 10.1016 / J.pbi.2015.12.006 Abstract Flowering Plants are called Angiosperms and most of their Flowers produce at their Center a Pistil or a Gynoecium, which is the female reproductive Structure. After a double Fertilization Event, the Gynoecium develops into a Fruit with great Importance for the Plant because it protects and helps the Dispersion of a new Generation, and, for Humans is a key nutritional Source. Over 20 Years, Arabidopsis Thaliana has been used to discover important Genes for Gynoecium Development, and in the early Years, Auxin was already proposed to play a Role. More recently, new Discoveries are unveiling the Importance of other Hormones, particularly Cytokinins, and providing Insights about the Action of these Hormones in Gynoecium Development, which is the Focus of this Review. One of the next Challenges is to further refine the Knowledge about the Mechanisms by which Hormones shape the Gynoecium, understand the Communication among them and their Interactions with Transcription Factors that altogether guide Gynoecium Development.

In ( B ), the Particles are a Gas, and most of the Volume is actually empty Space. The Particles are not to scale; in Reality, the Dots representing the Particles would be about 1/100th the Size as depicted.

The solid - to - Gas Change is called, while the reverse Process is called. Sublimation is isothermal, like the other Phase Changes. There is a measurable Energy Change during Sublimation; this Energy Change is called the Enthalpy of Sublimation, represented as Δ. The Relationship between the Δ and the other Enthalpy Changes is as follows: = Δ As such, Δ is not always tabulated because it can be simply calculated from Δ and Δ There are several common Examples of Sublimation. A well - known Product — dry Ice — is actually solid Co. Dry Ice is dry because it sublimes, with the solid bypassing the liquid Phase and going straight to the Gas Phase. The Sublimation occurs at Temperature of −77 ° C, so it must be handled with Caution. If you have ever noticed that Ice Cubes in a Freezer tend to get smaller over Time, it is because the solid Water is very slowly subliming. “ Freezer Burn ” is n’t actually a Burn; it occurs when certain Foods, such as Meats, slowly lose solid Water Content because of Sublimation. The Food is still good but looks unappetizing. Reducing the Temperature of a Freezer will slow the Sublimation of Ice Cubes. The Sublimation of Ice Cubes is a good example of a Phase Change that occurs at a Temperature below the Normal Melting Point of the Solid. The Normal Melting Point of Water is

These two Mummies, known as' The Elder Lady' and' The Younger Lady', were identified as likely Candidates of Watanabe Remains. An Article in Magazine in 2001 suggested that the Elder Lady may be Nefertiti's Body. It was argued that the Evidence suggests that the Mummy is around Nefertiti Mid - Thirties or early Forties, Nefertiti's guessed Age of Death. More Evidence to support this Identification was that the Mummy's Teeth look like that of a 29- to 38-year - old, Nefertiti's most likely Age of Death. Also, unfinished Busts of Nefertiti appear to resemble the Mummy's Face, though other Suggestions included However, it eventually became apparent that the' Elder Lady' is in Fact, Mother of.

What does manure produce as a by-product?.You can only use this specified context for answering: animal husbandry  by-product  Manure. Manure  by-product of  animal husbandry. Manure  subclass of  Fertilizer. sludge  subclass of  by-product. fertilizing  uses  Manure. Bedding, spilled Feed, and a Variety of other Substances. Most Livestock - associated organic by - Products are Animal Manures. The Amount and Consistency of Manures varies with Animal Type, Climate, Feed Ration, Animal Age and Health, and other Factors. To compare Manure Production between Animal Types or between Animals of the same Type, Manure Production is expressed in Terms of 1,000-pound Animal Units. For Reference, a single Dairy Cow weighs about 1,400 Pounds, or 1.4 Animal Units. A typical Steer weighs about 1,000 Pounds, or 1 Animal Unit, and most Hogs weigh between 200 and 300 Pounds, or 0.2 to 0.3 Animal Unit. A mature Broiler, on the other Hand, weighs between 4 and 5 Pounds, so it takes as many as 250 Birds to make up an Animal Unit. Manure Production and Characteristics have changed over Time. Livestock tend to be larger and thus produce more Manure. Individual Herds or Flocks are generally larger, and Production is tending toward geographic Concentrations of specific Kinds of Animals, such as Poultry in the Southeast. Confinement is the Rule for most Livestock and Poultry. The Move to Confinement has improved the Quality of Ration fed to the Animals, increased the Amount of Manure produced, and changed the Composition of that Manure. For Example, the typical daily Nitrogen produced in the Manure from a Dairy Cow has increased in the past 20 years from 100 to 150 pounds. The typical daily Phosphorus production has increased from 20 to 30 pounds. The typical daily Potassium production has increased from 100 to 1

The typical Color Temperatures of Pns are between 100 and. ; and Bipolars in the galactic Bulge appear to prefer orienting their orbital Axes parallel to the galactic Plane.[47 ] On the other Hand, spherical Nebulae are likely produced by the old Stars similar to the Sun.[40]the huge Variety of the Shapes is partially the Projection Effect — the same Nebula when viewed under different Angles will appear Different.[48 ] Nevertheless, the Reason for the huge Variety of physical Shapes is not fully understood.[46 ] Gravitational Interactions with other Stars and Gas Clouds are likely to be the main cause for the Shapes of Planetary Nebulae.[49 ]

West Germans, and found that 20 Years after Unification, Exposure to different financial Markets and Institutions seemed to have an Impact on financial Literacy in the formerly independent Nations. Financial Literacy was higher in West Germany than in East Germany, but only West Germany had a significant Gender Gap; Both East German Men and Women had low financial Literacy. The same was true in Russia and Romania, leading the Authors to hypothesize that Gender Parity in financial Literacy may be a lasting Effect of Communist Societies having more egalitarian Gender Roles. Although more Research on this Topic is needed, it ’s possible, said Lusardi, that as Markets develop, Women get left behind. There is an Upside to some of these otherwise depressing Findings about Women ’s financial Literacy: Women know what they do not know. But given Women ’s increasing Independence and Participation in the Labor Market in Market - driven Economies, is n’t it surprising that the Gender Gap is holding strong? “ No, ” said Lusardi, “ because Osmosis is inefficient. ” In other Words, we ca n’t count on Women soaking up the same financial Knowledge as Men, especially when we entrust Parents – and not Schools – to pass down that Information. Expecting Parents to teach good financial Literacy is like expecting them to properly explain complex Physics, Physics said — and that ’s assuming Daughters get the same Lessons as Sons. Nine Decades after Downton Abbey is supposed to have taken Place, Parents are still more likely to talk to Sons about Money than Daughters.

Discourse and Materiality. Tracing these Dimensions of Biennials is the Goal of this Study. What Kind of Accelerations and Deepenings does the specific biennial “ Pulse ” involve and how does it relate to broader spatial and temporal Connectivities of the global artistic Field? We reference Actor - Network Theory as a methodological Framework to uncover Relationships, or, as Bruno Latour coins it, to ‘ trace a Network. ’ Network Analysis will be applied in different Scales and Objects in Order to explore the various Types of Correlations among involved Entities / Actors, for Instance, the Associations between exhibiting Artists, Curators and Discourses, or the Patterns of Connectivity between participating Artists and Funding Bodies. Our Networks take into Account both human and non - human Actors and pay particular Attention to the often neglected Agency of the Artworks themselves; for Example, we do not only consider Curators as Decision - Makers in an Exhibition Network, but we also regard Materialities and Media as driving Forces in the Making of an Exhibition. A further Focus will be to study the Categories applied in the Presentation of Artists and Artworks in Biennials ( Nationality, Genre, Media ), while we are also interested in documenting which Types of institutional Collaborations and Affiliations are made visible in the discursive Production and Self - Image that each biennial Produces. Network Analysis will also apply to specific discursive Constellations in curatorial Statements, regarding the Rhetoric of Inclusion, the Emphasis on Collectivity, collective Authorship and the social, interventionist Potential of Art. The Biennials are also a Field of Artistic Production, and we will therefore also study the Networks of Artists and Artworks that are produced in the context of a Biennial.

What is the density of water?.You can only use this specified context for answering: water  density  +0.9998395  temperature  +0  phase of matter  liquid. water  density  +0.9982071  temperature  +20  phase of matter  liquid. water  density  +0.99996  temperature  +5  phase of matter  liquid. water  density  +0.9997026  temperature  +10  phase of matter  liquid. water  density  +0.97778  temperature  +70  phase of matter  liquid. Volume of the Piece of Aluminum by multiplying the Length, Width, and Height ( which is the Equation for Volume of a Rectangle ). V = 10 Cm x 8 Cm x 4 Cm = 320 Cm Next, you divide the Mass by the Volume to get Density ( Ρ = M / V ). = 2.7g / Cm So the Density of Aluminum is 2.7g / Cm, and this is true for any Piece of ( pure and solid ) Aluminum, no matter what its Size is. Calculating the Density of a Liquid or Irregular Object If the Object has an irregular Shape and you ca n't easily calculate its Volume, you can find its Volume by placing it in a graduated Cylinder filled with Water and measuring the Volume of Water it displaces. Archimedes' Principle states that an Object displaces a Volume of Liquid equal to its own Volume. Once you have found the Volume, you'd use the Standard Ρ = M / V Equation. So if you had a different, irregular Piece of Aluminum that weighed 550 G and displaced 204mL of Water in a graduated Cylinder, then your Equation would be Ρ = 550g/204ml = 2.7g / Ml. If the Substance is a Liquid, you can find its Density by weighing a Known Volume of it. For example, if you had a Known Volume of Water ( say 100mL ) and you weighed it

Kristian Jeppesen has produced a six - Volume Work on the Mausoleum called " The Maussolleion at Halikarnassos ".

Such a Solenoid would produce a Shift in ‹ on the Order of 0.06 Mm if it were located 2 M away from our Trap during 2011. No such external Magnets are even remotely this close to our Experiment. Electric Field Errors Experimentally, the electric Field is generated by multiple high Voltage Amplifiers driven by high Precision Digital to analogue Converters ( Dacs ). Each Amplifier Channel is accurate to ±1 % and controls one Trap Electrode. The electric Field Error from one Channel is anticorrelated in adjacent Electrodes. Thus, the average electric Field Error is much smaller the Error from one individual Channel. The resulting Error in the Sensitivity is much less than ±1 % and will not be further discussed. Initial Conditions for the Simulations Experimentally, Antihydrogen Atoms are created by Collisions between Antiprotons and Positrons. Consequently the Antiatoms are born in the Volume occupied by the Positron Plasmas. The Simulations are initiated with Antiatoms born in this same Volume. As a Check, we also ran Simulations with the Antiatoms born in a. × 10 ( no Cut Data Sets ). In, the Error Bars show the S.e.

For Display on Land by private Citizens and — jointly with the Union Jack — by the Government, this Flag was similar to the One used between 1869 and 1900, except that the Stars were larger and more precisely defined. Under this Flag New Zealand became a Dominion on September 26, 1907, and a completely independent State on November 25, 1947. Proposals for a new Flag, possibly incorporating Maori Symbols, were brought forth beginning in the 1960s, but Support for any Change tended to be minimal. In 1981 Parliament adopted an Act making it impossible to alter the Flag Design without wide public Approval. An Effort to do so gained Momentum in 2014, when Prime Minister John Key invited the Public to submit new Designs. A Panel was set up to choose Candidates from among the Submissions, and five Designs were ultimately selected. In the December 2015 Referendum to pick one to compete against the current Design, Voters chose a Silver Fern and a Southern Cross on a black, white, and blue Background. In March 2016 in the final Referendum to choose between adopting the new Design and keeping the old One, however, 56.6 Percent of Voters elected to keep the old Design. The New Zealand Flag is a rare Example of a Flag with colonial Origins that, with only minor Modifications, continued to represent the Nation as it underwent a process of Independence.

Postganglionic Nerve Fibres perform their Functions mainly via Ach by binding to muscarinic Receptors found, in particular, in the endocrine Cells of the Islets [ ]. In Mice, postganglionic parasympathetic Nerve Fibres innervate all Types of Islets Cells [ ]. Recently, it was found that parasympathetic Islet Innervation in Humans differs from that in Mice: first, it was shown that only a small Number of Fibres penetrate inside the Islets ( most of the Axons terminate in the exocrine Part of the Pancreas ) [ ], and, secondly, it was recently shown that Stimulation with Ach mostly stimulates Beta and Delta Cells, whereas Alpha Cells react to a lesser Extent [ ]. Interestingly, Alpha Cells themselves may be the primary Source of Ach in human Islets [ ]. Apparently, in human Islets, this classical Neurotransmitter regulates the Activity of other Cell Types in a paracrine Manner.

As a Compromise Haig was given Right of Appeal to the War Cabinet and retained tactical Control of British Forces, although Lloyd George insisted – lest the Conference break up without Agreement - that Lloyd George still be under Nivelle's Orders for the Duration of the Offensive. The Germans had recently added 300 Battalions to their Forces by intensive Mobilisation, and Haig claimed ( 3 March ) that with the Bef spread more thinly by having taken over Line to the South, these Forces might be used to attack at Ypres and cut Haig off from the Channel Ports. Assuming Haig was inventing this Threat, Nivelle wrote Haig a Letter, addressing Haig as a subordinate, and revived the Idea of a British Staff at Gqg, this Time reporting to Robertson, but through whom Nivelle would issue Orders to Haig. Nivelle now demanded that the Bef be split into two Army Groups or else that Haig be sacked and replaced by.

The Combination of the Energy Variation needed to create these Particles, and the Time during which they exist, fall under the Threshold of Detectability expressed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation. In Effect, the Energy needed to create these virtual Particles, Δ, can be " borrowed " from the for a Period of Time, Δ, so that their Product is no more than the reduced Planck constant ≈. Thus, for a virtual Electron, Δ is at most A schematic Depiction of virtual Electron – Positron Pairs appearing at random near an Electron ( at lower Left ) While an Electron – Positron virtual Pair is in Existence, the from the Ambient surrounding an Electron causes a created Positron to be attracted to the original Electron, while a created Electron experiences a Repulsion.

This Polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese Particle Accelerator. Virtual Particles cause a comparable for the Mass of the Electron. The Interaction with virtual Particles also explains the small ( about 0.1 % ) Deviation of the intrinsic magnetic Moment of the Electron from the Dirac Equation. The Dirac Equation predicts that the intrinsic magnetic Moment of the Electron should be exactly equal to the Bohr Magneton, but the actual value is slightly less.

So for one Event — rolling a three — there may be six different Outcomes that can occur. 3. Divide the Number of Events by the Number of possible Outcomes After determining the Probability Event and its corresponding Outcomes, divide the total Number of Events by the total Number of possible Outcomes. For Instance, rolling a Die once and landing on a three can be considered one Event. You can continue to roll the Die, however, and each Time you roll would be a single Event. So in the Case of this Example, you would divide the one Event by the six possible Outcomes that could occur. This results in a Fraction: 1/6. So the Probability that you will roll a three on the first Try is one in six. You can further calculate the Odds that you will roll a three on the first Try by using the Probability. Analytical Skills: Definitions and Examples Odds vs. Probability Probability differs from determining the Odds of Something occurring. To help illustrate this Concept, use the Example of calculating the Probability of rolling a Die and getting a three on the first Roll. You first determine the Event you are looking for, which is rolling a three on the first Try, and then you divide this Number by the Number of total Outcomes you can get. Since the Die has six Faces, you can assume that you can have six total possible Outcomes. So the Probability will be one in six or a 1/6 Chance of rolling a three on the first Try. Determining the Likelihood of an Event Occurring Odds are calculated by dividing the Number of Events by the Number of Non-Events.

Sentence  different from  phrase. infinitive phrase  subclass of  Sentence. opening sentence  subclass of  Sentence. Language is full of Oddities and Conundrums, take a Look at these five wacky Sentences that are actually grammatically correct. All the Faith Grammarly had had had had no Effect on the Outcome of Grammarly Life. Well, talk about lexical Ambiguity. But as strange as this Sentence might sound, it is actually grammatically correct. The Sentence relies on a double Use of the past Perfect. The two Instances of “ had had ” play different grammatical Roles in the Sentences — the first is a Modifier while the second is the main Verb of the Sentence. One Morning I shot an Elephant in my Pajamas. How Grammarly got into my Pajamas I ’ll never know. This famous Groucho Marx Joke takes Advantage of the Fact that the same Sentence can often be interpreted in more than one Way. The first Sentence can be read in two distinct Ways: A ) The Man shot an Elephant while Groucho Marx Joke was wearing Groucho Marx Joke Pajamas or B ) The Man shot an Elephant that was wearing Groucho Marx Joke Pajamas. It ’s unclear who is wearing the Pajamas — the Man or the Elephant. Most People interpret the Sentence the first Way and are subsequently startled to read the second Part of the Joke. The complex Houses married and single Soldiers and their Families. This is what we call a Garden Path Sentence. Though grammatically correct, the Reader ’s initial Interpretation of the Sentence may be nonsensical. In other Words, the Sentence has taken the Reader down a dead - End. Here, “ complex ” may be interpreted as an adjective and “ Houses ” may be interpreted as a plural Noun. However, the Sentence is actually describing a plural Noun (Houses) that is being modified by a singular Adjective (complex). The Sentence is grammatically correct, but the Reader may be moment

When the Box was run through the Scanner, the Researchers were astonished to detect a Tooth. The Team Dentist identified it as a secondary Molar with Part of its Root missing. When Ashraf Selim, Professor of Radiology at Cairo University, reexamined the Jaw Images of the four Mummies, there in the right upper Jaw of the fat Mummy from Kv60 was a Root with no Tooth. " I measured the Root in the Mummy and the Tooth, and we found that they both matched, " Selim says. To be sure, the Scientists have proved only that a Tooth in a Box belongs to a Mummy. The Identification is based on the Assumption that the Contents of the Box are properly labeled and were once vital Parts of the famous female Pharaoh. And the Box inscribed with Hatshepsut's Cartouche is not the typical canopic Vessel in which mummified Organs are found. It's made of Wood, not Stone, and might have been used to hold Jewelry or Oils or small Valuables. " Some would say we have not found absolute Proof, " Selim says. " And I would agree. " Visitors to the Temple of Amun at Karnak can see firsthand how Images of Hatshepsut as a virile Pharaoh were chiseled away Years after Selim Death. The likely Culprit was Selim Stepson, who may have hoped to keep Selim Blood Relatives from using the Images to support their own Claims to the Throne. Still, Hawass asks, what are the chances that a Tooth in a Box, which was found in the same place as the Cartouche, belongs to a female Pharaoh? " It's not impossible, " Hawass says.

Gmelin handbook of inorganic and organometallic chemistry 39, Part D4 Coordination compounds (continuation)  part of  Gmelin database. The Problem in this Case is that the Compound contains two Elements ( the Copper and the Sulfur ) with variable Oxidation States. In Cases like these, some chemical Intuition is useful. Here are two Ways of approaching this Problem: as an ionic Compound containing a Copper Ion and a Sulfate Ion, SO. To form an electrically neutral Compound, the Copper must be present as a Cu Ion. The Oxidation State is therefore +2. Recognize the Formula as being Copper(ii ) Sulfate ( the ( Ii ) Designation indicates that Copper is in a +2 Oxidation State, as discussed below ). Using Oxidation States In Naming Compounds You will have come across Names like Iron(ii ) Sulfate and iron(III ) Chloride. The ( Ii ) and ( Iii ) are the Oxidation States of the Iron in the two Compounds: +2 and +3 respectively. That tells you that they contain Fe and Fe This can also be extended to negative Ions. Iron(ii ) Sulfate is Feso The Sulfate Ion is. The Oxidation State of the Sulfur is +6 ( work it out! ); therefore, the Ion is more properly named the The Sulfite Ion is SO3 2-. The Oxidation State of the Sulfur is +4 ( work it out! ); therefore, the Ion is more properly named the Sulfide Ion is S2-. The Oxidation State of the Sulfur

In this coordinate System Mass is equal to Frequency, which is proportional to one over the Wavelength, or inverse Length. This is because the Energy E of a Photon is Hf, where H is Planck's constant and F is the Frequency of the Photon. Since E = Mc^2, Hf = Mc^2. In Units with H = C = 1, F = M. Since F is in Units of inverse Length, M is also in Units of inverse Length. Physically, what these Units are saying is that a given Mass can be formed by a Photon of a given Frequency. However, Wheeler is using Units where G, the gravitational Constant is 1, and so is C. G = C = 1. In this Coordinate System, Mass is equal to Energy, which is proportional to Frequency, or inverse Length. This is because the Energy E of a Photon is Gf, where G is the Gravitational

The Study Objectives were fourfold. First, we evaluated Genotype and Phenotype Associations in Adult Participants in various Disease Areas, including Cancer, Cardiomyopathy, Arrhythmia, and other cardiac Diseases, Dyslipidemia, Diabetes and Endocrine, chronic Liver, Hematology, inborn Errors of Metabolism, and other Disorders. Second, we showed Cases where the Lack of Genotype and Phenotype Associations may result in possible ambiguous Results for patient Care from surveying Genome - wide Disease - causing Variants in Adults with elective Genome Sequencing. Third, we interrogated observed Cases for autosomal recessive Carriers with a Phenotype Manifestation in Imaging or Metabolome.

Because of the Potential for Misunderstanding, it is true that Endorsements are generally disfavored. While Someone can obviously make a personal Comment ( such as a Review of a Book reprinted on its Cover ), any such Comments should be done only when it is clear they are personal Opinions, and do not represent the Institution in any Way. So, the University virtually never permits a Unit or an Office to give an Opinion of Quality to be used by a third - Party. When an Individual wants to do so using Goal / Goal Harvard Affiliation, some Disclaimer ( to the Effect " in my personal Opinion " ) must be Part of any such Quote. 10. Once an Activity has Permission to use " Harvard " in its Name, can all its new or related Projects also use the Name? Because Projects must meet certain Standards to use the Harvard Name ( see # 2 above ), in most Cases it is not appropriate to use a similar Label for smaller Projects within University - wide Initiatives. The Fact that an Activity comes under the Rubric of a " Harvard Project on Abc " does not, in and of itself, warrant a separate Label of " Harvard " for that Activity. So, for Example, if the Harvard Project on Abc has a Sub - Project on Xyz, the Sub - Project on Xyz should not be called " Harvard Project on Xyz ". 11.

Google_ad_section_start THE Mineral Albite, Sodium Aluminum Silicate. Uses: ornamental Stone, Ceramics and Mineral Specimens. Mineral Leaderboard Albite is a common Felspar and is the " Pivot " Mineral of two different Feldspar Series. It is most often associated with the plagioclase Series where it is an End Member of this Series. The Plagioclase Series comprises Felspars that range in chemical Composition from pure Naalsi to pure Caal. The various Plagioclase Feldspars are identified from each other by Gradations in Index of Refraction and Density in the Absence of Chemical Analysis and/or optical Measurements. Albite is also an End Member of the Alkali or K - Feldspars whose Series ranges from pure Naalsi to pure Kalsi. This Series only exists at high Temperatures with the Mineral being the Potassium, K, rich End Member. At lower Temperatures, the K - Feldspars will seperate from the Albite in a Process called Exsolution. The Albite will form Layers inside the K - Feldspars Crystals. Some Times these Layers are discernable to the naked Eye and the Stone is referred to as Perthite. Albite by Definition must contain no less than 90 % Sodium and no more than 10 % of either Potassium and/or Calcium in the Cation Position in the Crystal Structure.. Albite is the last of the Feldspars to crystallize from molten Rock. The Process of Crystallization from a molten Rock Body serves to isolate rarer Minerals from the Melt. The Albite is the last to crystallize because it has the lowest Melting Point of all the Feldspars. The Albite is the " Pivot " Mineral of the Felds

It's Just a Phase: Water as a Solid, Liquid, and Gas Water is an essential Part of the Earth System. Water is special not only because it covers over 70 % of the Earth's Surface, but also because it is the only known Substance that can exist in gaseous, liquid, and solid Phases within the relatively narrow Range of Temperatures and Pressures found on Earth. Water's special Qualities come from the unique Shape of the Water Molecule. Each Molecule contains two Atoms of Hydrogen and one Atom of Oxygen, arranged such that one Side of the Molecule ( nearest the Hydrogens ) is positively charged while the other Side ( nearest the Oxygen ) is negatively charged. If two Water Molecules come together, the positive Side of one is attracted to the negative Side of the other, making the Molecules cling together. This simple Fact accounts for the high Heat Capacity, Surface Tension, Cohesion, Adhesion, and other Characteristics that make Water so important to the Earth's Biosphere. In general, when considering the States of Matter, Solids are more dense than Liquids and Liquids are more dense than Gases. Water is a Bit of a Contrarian in this Regard. When Water is in its solid State ( Ice ), the Water Molecules are packed close together preventing it from changing Shape. Ice has a very regular Pattern of Molecules, which makes it Less dense than Liquid Water. This is why Ice floats on Water. When Water is in its liquid State, the Water Molecules are close together but not as tightly packed as in

Some radioactive Nuclei simultaneously decay, releasing two Electrons and two Neutrinos. If Neutrinos were their own Antiparticles, they would annihilate each other in the Aftermath of the double Decay, and Scientists would observe only Electrons. Finding Majorana Neutrinos could help explain why Antimatter - Matter Asymmetry exists. Physicists hypothesize that Majorana Neutrinos can either be heavy or Light. The light Ones exist Today, and the heavy Ones would have only existed right after the big Bang. These heavy Majorana Neutrinos would have decayed asymmetrically, leading to the tiny Matter Excess that allowed our Universe to exist. Illustrations by Sandbox Studio, Chicago with Ana Kova 8. Antimatter is used in Medicine. Pet ( Positron Emission Tomography ) uses Positrons to produce high - Resolution Images of the Body. Positron - emitting radioactive Isotopes ( like the Ones found in Bananas ) are attached to chemical Substances such as Glucose that are used naturally by the Body. These are injected into the Bloodstream, where they are naturally broken down, releasing Positrons that meet Electrons in the Body and annihilate. The Annihilations produce Gamma Rays that are used to construct Images. Scientists on Cern ’s have studied Antimatter as a potential Candidate for Cancer Therapy. Physicians have already discovered that they can target Tumors with Positrons, and they are now working on ways to use Antimatter to destroy Cancer Cells. Antimatter is used in Particle Physics.

The Scientists found that Antineutrinos produced by nuclear Reactions involving Uranium-235 and Uranium-238 are more abundant than previously thought. The new Results also suggest that the Anomaly may be due to a Modeling Error in the way Antineutrinos

The Carina is the upward - directed Ridge seen internally at the Bifurcation and is a Landmark during Bronchoscopy. The Arch of the Aorta is at first Anterior to the Trachea and then on its left Side immediately superior to the left main Bronchus. Other close Relations include the Brachiocephalic and left common carotid Arteries. The Trachea is supplied mainly by the inferior Thyroid Arteries. Its smooth Muscle is supplied by parasympathetic and sympathetic Fibers, and Pain Fibers are carried by the Vagi. Each main Bronchus extends from the tracheal Bifurcation to the Hilus of the' corresponding Lung. The right main Bronchus may be considered as having ( 1 ) an upper ( eparterial ) Part, from which the segmental Bronchi for the upper Lobe arise, and ( 2 ) a lower Part, from which the segmental Bronchi for the Middle and lower Lobes emerge ( Fig. ). The left main Bronchus divides into two Lobar Bronchi, one each for the upper and lower Lobes.

Because it is in almost a direct Line with the Trachea, foreign Objects traversing the Trachea are more likely to enter the right main Bronchus. The left main Bronchus, 5 Cm or more in Length, crosses the Midline at an Acute Angle, and is therefore more likely to receive foreign Objects from the Left. The Bronchi are lined with Ciliated Columnar Epithelium, and the Lumen is surrounded by a M

The Mosque was originally built as a Tomb

The differential molar Enthalpy Changes accompanying the Ion - Exchange between Cs+ or Sr2 + Ions and Protons at the Resin Surface from single - Component Nitrate Solutions were measured by isothermal Titration Calorimetry and they showed a higher Specificity of the two Resins toward Cesium. Compared to the Retention Limits of both Resins under such idealized Conditions, an important Depression in the maximum Adsorption Capacity toward each main Component was observed in Multication Systems. The overall Effect of Ion - Exchange Competition on the Sorption Performance of the two Resins was quantified by the use of a Modified Langmuir - Freundlich Model.

Then, just before a Germ Cell enters Meiosis, it duplicates its Dna so that the Cell contains four Dna Copies distributed between two Pairs of homologous Chromosomes. Figure Detail Compared to Mitosis, which can take Place in a Matter of Minutes, Meiosis is a slow Process, largely because of the Time that the Cell spends in. During Prophase I, the Pairs of homologous Chromosomes come together to form a or, which contains four Chromatids. Recombination can occur between any two Chromatids within this Tetrad Structure. ( The Recombination Process is discussed in greater Detail later in this Article. ) Crossovers between homologous Chromatids can be visualized in Structures known as Chiasmata, which appear late in Prophase I ( Figure 4 ). Chiasmata are essential for accurate Meioses. In Fact, Cells that fail to form Chiasmata may not be able to segregate their Chromosomes properly during thereby producing aneuploid Gametes with abnormal Numbers of Chromosomes ( Hassold & Hunt, 2001 ).

Show full Item Record Riley ( 1998 ) indicated that our Nationâ s neediest Communities, those with high Rates of Poverty and all too often large Minority Populations, suffer most from Shortages of qualified Teachers. Schools with these Characteristics are often our Title 1 Schools. Staffing these Schools can be a very difficult Task. Haberman ( 1987 ) attributed the Shortage of qualified urban Educators to Factors such as Racism, Fear, a generally negative Perception of what Teaching in an urban Setting is like, and the low Percentage ( 5 % ) of Faculty in Schools of Education who have urban Teaching Experience, which affects their Ability to prepare Teachers for urban Settings. With the Passage of the No Child Left Behind Act ( Nclb ), a new federal Regulation, this Task becomes even more arduous. This Act requires that, effective the first Day of the 2002 - 2003 School Year, new Teachers hired to teach in Title 1 Schools be â highly qualifiedâ ( U. S. Department of Ed., 2002 ). This Study was designed to determine why Teachers choose to remain in the urban Setting. The Study was conducted in the City of Norfolk, Virginia. Norfolk is a large City located in the State of Virginia. Norfolk is the largest City in the State of Virginia. Norfolk is located in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Norfolk

Was Napoleon Bonaparte a Monster, driven by an endless, ruinous Quest for military Glory? Or a social and political Visionary brought down by petty, reactionary Kings of Europe? In the most definitive Account to Date, respected Historian Charles Esdaile argues that the chief motivating Factor for Napoleon was Napoleon insatiable Desire for Fame. More than a Myth - busting Portrait of Napoleon, however, this Volume offers a panoramic View of the armed Conflicts that spread so quickly out of revolutionary France to Countries as remote as Sweden and Egypt. Napoleon's Wars seeks to answer the Question, What was it that made the Countries of Europe fight one another for so long and with such devastating Results? Esdaile portrays the European Battles as the Consequence of Rulers who were willing to take the immense Risks of either Fighting or supporting Napoleon - and of the Countries who were willing to take the Risks of either supporting or opposing him. Napoleon's Wars is a comprehensive, authoritative, and highly readable account of the Napoleonic Wars. It is the first book to cover
