# Guide to scripts, data, and results for LLM experiments in UNIQORN

Below we provide a short guide to the various scripts and data used in the LLM experiments (zero-shot and RAG) for UNIQORN, and the result files they generated. The files are organized into topical directories, but we provide the short descriptions of what each file does, as a flat list below for easy reference. This should be helpful for reproducibility of the desired experiments. Note that the backend LLMs are constantly updated (espcially GPT-4o accessed via the API), so exact repeatability of the reported values is not guaranteed. But we expect overall trends of the experiments to hold good for some time. The original experiments were conducted in July 2024.
